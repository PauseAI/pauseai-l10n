  The last thing we did was successfully push and Netlify preview our changes on the paraglide branch. I also tested that building with 
  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en makes a website that hides the other locales (which is what we want, because it means we can integrate the branch back into 
  mainline without exposing the new feature yet.)

  The next thing to do in preparation for that will be to merge changes from mainline into this branch, resolving conflicts.

  Have a good think and describe how we do that. Remember to share your plan with me for centaur review before executing on it.

✻ Thinking…

  Let me understand what we need to do:

  1. We have a paraglide branch with localization features.
  2. We've verified it works properly, including being able to hide non-English locales with PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en.
  3. Now we need to merge changes from the mainline branch into our paraglide branch to resolve any conflicts before we can merge paraglide back 
  into mainline.

  To do this well, I need to:
  1. Understand the current branch structure and repository state
  2. Check what branch we're on and what branches exist
  3. Figure out what the "mainline" branch is called (probably main or master)
  4. Plan a merge strategy that minimizes conflicts and ensures code quality

  Let me first check what branch we're currently on and what the repository structure looks like.

  From the context, I can see we're on the main branch according to git status:
  Current branch: main

  So we're not on the paraglide branch right now. We need to first switch to the paraglide branch.

  Also, according to the project CLAUDE.md, the code we're working with is in notes/references/website-prototype, which contains a prototype 
  paraglide branch of the GitHub pauseai-website repository.

  So we need to:
  1. Go to the right directory (notes/references/website-prototype)
  2. Check what branch we're on in that directory
  3. Pull the latest changes from the mainline branch
  4. Merge the mainline branch into the paraglide branch
  5. Resolve any conflicts that arise

  Here's my plan to do this:

  1. First, change to the notes/references/website-prototype directory
  2. Check what branch we're on with git branch
  3. If not on the paraglide branch, switch to it with git checkout paraglide
  4. Ensure the paraglide branch is up to date with git pull origin paraglide
  5. Fetch the latest changes from the main/mainline branch with git fetch origin main (assuming the mainline branch is called "main")
  6. Merge the mainline branch into paraglide with git merge origin/main
  7. Resolve any conflicts that arise
  8. Commit the merged changes
  9. (Optionally) push the updated paraglide branch to the remote repository

  This approach will:
  - Keep our work on the paraglide branch
  - Incorporate all the latest changes from the mainline branch
  - Give us a chance to resolve any conflicts locally before merging paraglide back into mainline

  Let me present this plan to the user for their review before proceeding.

● Based on the context and our goals, here's my plan for merging mainline changes into the paraglide branch:

  1. Navigate to the website-prototype directory
  2. Check we're on the paraglide branch
  3. Pull latest paraglide changes
  4. Fetch latest changes from mainline
  5. Merge mainline into paraglide
  6. Resolve any conflicts
  7. Test build to verify functionality

  Does this approach work for you, or would you like adjustments before we proceed?

> Grand. You don't need to check we're at HEAD of paraglide with no changes pending. Please perform the merge but don't resolve conflicts until 
  confirming how we plan to resolve each file. Handle them one at a time.

● I'll proceed with the merge and we'll handle conflicts one at a time. Let's start:

● Bash(cd notes/references/website-prototype && git branch)…
  ⎿    backup/paraglide
       main
     * paraglide
       paraglide-backup
       paraglide-backup-original
       paraglide-reorg-1-foundation

● Bash(cd notes/references/website-prototype && git fetch origin main)…
  ⎿  /bin/bash: line 1: cd: notes/references/website-prototype: No such file or directory

● Let me check the correct path:

● List(path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references")…

     <<<<<<< HEAD
     You can create and edit most content using [Decap CMS](https://pauseai-cms.netlify.app/), a user-friendly web interface for managing content.
     … +100 more lines

● Let's examine the first conflict in README.md. We need to decide how to merge the changes from both branches. It appears the paraglide branch
  (HEAD) has additional information about localization in the "Creating Articles" section, and a slightly different "Deployment" section.

  Let's look at the next conflict in netlify.toml:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/netlify.toml")…
  ⎿  # Settings for the [build] key are global and are applied to
     # all deploy contexts unless overridden by a context-specific setting.
     [build]
       # Directory where the build system installs dependencies
       # and runs your build. Store your package.json, .nvmrc, etc here.
       # If not set, defaults to the root directory.
       base = "/"
       # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and
       # assets generated by the build. This is an absolute path relative
     … +23 more lines

● Next, let's look at package.json:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/package.json")…
  ⎿  {
       "type": "module",
       "name": "pause-ai",
       "private": true,
       "packageManager": "pnpm@9.14.4",
       "scripts": {
         "clean": "tsx scripts/clean.ts",
         "inlang:force": "tsx scripts/inlang-settings.ts --force",
         "translate": "tsx scripts/translation/translate",
         "translate:debug": "tsx scripts/translation/translate --mode debug",
     … +96 more lines

● Based on these conflicts, I'll analyze and propose how to resolve each one:

  1. README.md:
    - The paraglide branch has added localization information to the "Creating Articles" section and has a slightly different "Deployment" section.
    - The main branch has added a "Collaboration" section.
    - Proposal: Keep both the localization info from paraglide AND the Collaboration section from main.
  2. netlify.toml:
    - Main branch adds a [context.deploy-preview] section with a different build command for preview deployments.
    - Paraglide branch doesn't have this section.
    - Proposal: Keep the deploy-preview context from main branch.
  3. package.json:
    - There's a conflict in the devDependencies section for types.
    - Paraglide has @types/minimist and @types/remark-heading-id that main doesn't.
    - Main has a newer version of @types/node.
    - Proposal: Keep all type dependencies, using the newest @types/node from main.

  What do you think about these proposals? Should we proceed with resolving the conflicts this way?

> Resolve the conflict in README.md then stop.

● I'll resolve the README.md conflict and stop there as requested:

● I've successfully resolved the conflicts in the README.md file:

  1. In the "Creating Articles" section:
    - Kept the paraglide branch content that includes the localization details
    - Preserved the note about special pages requiring editing outside the CMS
    - Maintained the localization-related note about inspecting translations
  2. In the "Deployment" and "Collaboration" sections:
    - Kept the paraglide branch wording for deployment
    - Added the "Collaboration" section from the main branch

  I've stopped after resolving the README.md conflicts as requested. The other conflicts in netlify.toml, package.json, and other files still remain
   and would need to be addressed separately.

> I'm a bit surprised by the change to netlify.toml on main. Under exactly what circumstance does the command under [context.deploy-preview] run? 
  What environment variables re development/production will be set when it is?

● The [context.deploy-preview] section in netlify.toml specifies configuration that applies specifically to Netlify deploy previews. Let me explain:

  1. Deploy previews are automatically created when you make a pull request to your repository.
  2. The command = "pnpm run build:dev" in [context.deploy-preview] means Netlify will run this command instead of the default build command when
  building a deploy preview.
  3. Looking at package.json, build:dev runs with NODE_ENV=development, while the regular build script runs with NODE_ENV=production.

  This setup allows deploy previews to be built with development settings, which typically means:
  - Fewer optimizations
  - More verbose logging
  - Additional debugging features

  Regular production deployments (from the main branch) would still use the standard production build process.

> Hmmm. As of paraglide, one of the main differences in build:dev is that it will run translation in dry-run mode, using whatever values are already
   cached rather than calling LLMs to create ones that need to be updated. That is safe, but makes the preview less useful and representative. The 
  eventual aim is that we and developers can see in preview how any new content they introduce gets translated.

  So when working on the paraglide branch, we've run the usual prod-configured build in that case, so that new translations are created and visible.

  However, it makes me realize we're relying on paraglide being a branch that our main audience can't see. As is, if we made the same choice to 
  build with updated translations on mainline, then a pull request can affect the content of our main translations repository. After that, any 
  future mainline build could see those translations, make a website featuring them, and deploy it. Our main website could end up displaying 
  translations triggered by an exernal party making a pull request.

  This isn't really a problem yet, even after we merge paraglide onto mainline, since we won't be exposing translated content until we've done more 
  review. But I will need to remember to fix it!

  (A possible approach would be to use something like a branch of the translation cache repository for previews: environment variables we can change
   per Netlify stage will allow this.)

  Let me know what you think. But for now, proceed and merge the mainline change to netlify.toml.

✻ Thinking…

  You're raising an excellent point about the security and workflow implications of how translations are handled in deploy previews. Let me 
  summarize your concerns and thoughts:

  1. In paraglide branch, you've been using the production build configuration for deploy previews, which creates actual translations via LLM calls 
  when needed, making the preview more representative.
  2. The mainline change wants to use a development build for deploy previews (build:dev) which would run translations in dry-run mode, using only 
  cached translations without making new LLM calls.
  3. Security concern: If external contributors can trigger actual translations through PRs, those translations could potentially make their way 
  into the main translation cache repository and eventually into production.
  4. Your thought for the future is to potentially use branch-specific translation caches for different environments (e.g., a separate branch for 
  preview translations).
  5. For now, you want to proceed with merging the mainline change to netlify.toml, which would change deploy previews to use build:dev instead of 
  the regular build command.

  This is a thoughtful consideration of the translation workflow security. The branch-specific translation cache approach you're thinking of would 
  indeed help separate translations generated from external PRs from those that go into production.

  For now, I'll proceed with merging the netlify.toml change as you instructed.

● You've identified an important security consideration around translations in the PR preview workflow. You're right that there's a potential vector
   where external contributors could influence your translation cache through PRs if preview builds trigger actual translations.

  Your idea of using branch-specific translation caches controlled by environment variables for different build contexts is a good solution. This
  would isolate preview-generated translations from your production translation cache.

  This is definitely something to address before exposing translated content publicly after the paraglide merge, but your current approach of
  keeping translations hidden with PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en mitigates immediate risk.

  I'll proceed with merging the netlify.toml change from mainline:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/netlify.toml)…

● I'll implement the package.json resolution and then plan for the next conflict files:

● Now I'll check the remaining conflicts that need resolution:

● Bash(cd /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype && git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)…
  ⎿  README.md
     netlify.toml
     package.json
     pnpm-lock.yaml
     src/lib/airtable.ts
     src/lib/components/Home.svelte
     src/posts/faq.md
     src/posts/funding.md
     src/posts/protests.md
     src/routes/+layout.svelte
     template.env

● We've already fixed three files. Here's my plan for the remaining conflicts:

  1. pnpm-lock.yaml:
    - This is a generated lock file, and we should generally use the most recent one.
    - Proposal: Since we're merging main into paraglide, we should use main's version unless there are dependencies from the paraglide branch that
  need to be preserved.
  2. src/lib/airtable.ts:
    - We'd need to inspect the specific changes to understand the conflict.
    - Proposal: Preserve paraglide's localization-specific code while incorporating any improvements from main.
  3. src/lib/components/Home.svelte:
    - This may involve UI changes that need to be compatible with paraglide's localization.
    - Proposal: Keep paraglide's localization structure while integrating main's new content/features.
  4. src/posts/faq.md, funding.md, protests.md:
    - These are content files that may have been updated on both branches.
    - Proposal: Preserve both sets of changes where possible, keeping paraglide's localization-specific annotations.
  5. src/routes/+layout.svelte:
    - This layout file may contain structural changes that affect localization.
    - Proposal: Preserve paraglide's localization features while incorporating main's layout improvements.
  6. template.env:
    - This includes environment variables that may differ between branches.
    - Proposal: Keep variables from both branches, ensuring paraglide's localization variables are included.

  For each file, I recommend we:
  1. Examine the specific conflict
  2. Understand both branches' changes
  3. Create a merged version that preserves localization functionality while incorporating other improvements
  4. Verify the merged file works correctly

  Do you want me to proceed with examining and resolving any specific file next?

> pnpm-lock.yaml: disagree, instead we should generate this file at the end after resolving all other conflicts.
  airtable.ts: yes; main probably has the better features here. I implemented fallbacks for developers in the absence of keys on main, while I 
  patched paraglide for a similar circumstance less usefully
  Home.svelte: abstract description seems right
  *.md: yes; probably paraglide doesn't have real changes, I think we've resolved these files when merging from main before
  +layout.svelte: abstract description seems right and this is likely to be the most interesting conflict
  template.env: I've been trying to work in a way that should mean paraglide has the best version, but we'll see

  Understand the airtable conflict and propose what to do. If complex, describe abstractly before proceeding to make changes.

✻ Thinking…

  Let's examine the airtable.ts conflict to understand what changes each branch has made:

● Let me examine the airtable.ts conflict:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts")…
  ⎿  import { options } from '$lib/api.js'
     import { isDev, getDevContext } from '$lib/env.ts'
     type AirtableResponse = {
       records: Record<string, unknown>[]
       offset: number
     }
     /**
      * Fetches all pages from Airtable API (which is limited to 100 items per page)
     … +83 more lines

● After analyzing the airtable.ts conflict, here's what I've found:

  1. Main branch changes (lines 62-70):
    - Uses isDevelopment (from the environment) for better consistency
    - Has more descriptive error messages
    - Explicitly checks fallbackData.length > 0 before using fallback data
    - Better warning message when using fallback data
  2. Paraglide branch changes (lines 52-61):
    - Uses a function isDev() and getDevContext() imported from '$lib/env.ts'
    - Less detailed error handling
    - Doesn't check if fallback data exists before returning it

  Proposed Resolution:
  The main branch has better error handling and consistency. I recommend adopting the main branch version but preserving the getDevContext() call
  for more detailed logging. This will combine the better error handling structure from main with the additional context information from paraglide.

  Here's my proposed change:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  String to replace not found in file.

● I apologize for the error. Let me check the file again more carefully and try with more context:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  String to replace not found in file.

● I'll try a different approach by reading the file with different line endings:

● Bash(cd /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype && cat -A src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Preserve use of isDev from paraglide rather than isDevelopment from main: we did better env work on the branch

● Understood. Let me revise my approach to preserve the isDev() function usage from paraglide branch while taking the better error handling
  structure from main.

  Let me check the file more carefully:

● Bash(cd /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype && git checkout --conflict=diff3 src/lib/airtable.ts && cat …
      src/lib/airtable.ts | grep -A 20 -B 2 '<<<<<')
  ⎿  			if (!response.ok) {
     				const errorText = await response.text()
     <<<<<<< ours
     				console.error(
     					`${getDevContext()} Airtable API error:`,
     					response.status,
     					response.statusText,
     					errorText
     				)
     				if (isDev()) {
     					return allRecords
     				}
     ||||||| base
     				console.error('Airtable API error:', response.status, response.statusText, errorText)
     =======
     				console.error('Airtable API error:', response.status, response.statusText, errorText)

     				if (isDevelopment && fallbackData.length > 0) {
     					console.warn('⚠️ Using fallback data in development mode due to Airtable API error')
     					return fallbackData
     				}

     >>>>>>> theirs
  ⎿  Recreated 1 merge conflict

● Now I'll resolve the conflict in airtable.ts, preserving isDev() usage from paraglide while incorporating the better error handling structure:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts with 2 additions and 12 removals
     49        const response = await customFetch(fullUrl, options)
     50        if (!response.ok) {
     51          const errorText = await response.text()
     52  <<<<<<< ours
     52          console.error(
     53            `${getDevContext()} Airtable API error:`,
     54            response.status,
     55            response.statusText,
     56            errorText
     57          )
     58          if (isDev()) {
     59            return allRecords
     60          }
     61  ||||||| base
     62          console.error('Airtable API error:', response.status, response.statusText, errorText)
     63  =======
     64          console.error('Airtable API error:', response.status, response.statusText, errorText)
     65  
     66          if (isDevelopment && fallbackData.length > 0) {
     58          
     59          if (isDev() && fallbackData.length > 0) {
     60            console.warn('⚠️ Using fallback data in development mode due to Airtable API error')
     61            return fallbackData
     62          }
     63  
     64  >>>>>>> theirs
     63          throw new Error(
     64            `Failed to fetch data from Airtable: ${response.statusText}. Details: ${errorText}`
     65          )

● Now I need to also fix one other instance of isDevelopment in the catch block:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal
     74    } catch (error) {
     75      console.error('Error in fetchAllPages:', error)
     76 
     77      if (isDevelopment && fallbackData.length > 0) {
     77      if (isDev() && fallbackData.length > 0) {
     78        console.warn('⚠️ Using fallback data in development mode due to error')
     79        return fallbackData
     80      }

● And since we're no longer using the isDevelopment variable, I'll remove it as well:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts with 3 removals
     18    url: string,
     19    fallbackData: Record<string, unknown>[] = []
     20  ) {
     21    // Check if we're in development mode
     22    const isDevelopment = import.meta.env.MODE === 'development'
     23  
     21    let allRecords: Record<string, unknown>[] = []
     22    // https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/list-records#query-pagesize
     23    let offset

● And fix the last instance of isDevelopment:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/airtable.ts with 1 addition and 1 removal
     30 
     31    // If API key is not configured
     32    if (!apiKeyConfigured) {
     33      if (isDevelopment) {
     33      if (isDev()) {
     34        console.warn('⚠️ Airtable API key not configured. Using fallback data in development mode.')
     35        return fallbackData
     36      } else {

● The airtable.ts conflict has been resolved with these changes:

  1. Replaced all instances of isDevelopment with isDev() from the paraglide branch
  2. Kept the improved error handling from the main branch, including:
    - Better warning messages for fallback data use
    - Checking fallbackData.length > 0 before using it
  3. Preserved the contextual logging from paraglide branch with getDevContext()
  4. Removed the redundant isDevelopment variable declaration since we're using isDev() function

  This combines the better environment variable handling from paraglide with the more robust error management from main.

  Should we proceed to look at the next conflict, or would you like to make any adjustments to this resolution?

● The conflict in Home.svelte is significant:

  1. Paraglide branch (ours) has completely localized the home page blocks:
    - All text is pulled from translation messages (using m.*) functions)
    - Has added two additional blocks: urgency and action
    - Uses HTML formatting with the {@html ...} syntax for titles
  2. Main branch (theirs) has:
    - Updated the proposal text content (changed from "AI systems more powerful than GPT-4" to "the most powerful general AI systems")
    - Continues to use hardcoded English text

  The best approach here is to keep the paraglide branch's localization structure while incorporating the content updates from main. Since we need
  to make sure the localized content reflects the latest wording, we should:

  1. Keep the paraglide structure with message functions
  2. Check that the messages in our translation files have the updated wording from main

● The Home.svelte conflict has been resolved by:

  1. Keeping the paraglide branch's localization structure (using message functions)
  2. Updating the source English message to reflect the updated wording from main
  3. Preserving all the additional blocks (urgency and action) from paraglide

  Let's examine the next conflict - let's look at the layout.svelte file:

  ⎿  Recreated 1 merge conflict

● Looking at the +layout.svelte conflict, there are several important differences:

  1. Import differences:
    - Paraglide branch imports Banner component
    - Main branch imports Hero and NearbyEvent components
  2. Additional variables:
    - Paraglide has comments about using $page store for more reliable navigation
    - Main adds an eventFound boolean variable
  3. Structural differences:
    - Paraglide branch has an entirely different layout structure with <div> wrapper and proper hierarchy
    - Main branch adds a <NearbyEvent> component before the layout div

  This is a complex conflict that affects the core layout structure. Let me propose a resolution that incorporates both changes:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…

> Was/is the comment from ours correct?

● Looking at the comment in the "ours" branch, it says:

  // We use $page store instead of data prop for more reliable navigation
  // This prevents "undefined" issues during navigation

  This comment is accurate and valuable. It explains why the code uses the $page store rather than directly using the data prop in certain places -
  it provides more reliability during navigation and prevents potential "undefined" issues that could occur during transitions.

  The code reference immediately below the comment is the hero calculation:
  $: hero = $page.url.pathname === `/${getLocale()}` || (getLocale() === 'en' && $page.url.pathname === '/')

  This is using the $page store as described in the comment, which makes the comment contextually relevant.

  So yes, the comment from "ours" is correct and helpful for maintainability.

> You may be planning to reintroduce hero later I guess, since seems we won't want to drop it entirely.

  In passing, can you imagine what the unchanged guard can be trying to do? Is it really checking that a list of strings that are paths from URLs 
  don't contain the locale ("en", etc.) as a substring? I'm bemused.

● You're right to question that guard. Looking at this line:

  {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(getLocale())}
      <Toc />

  This doesn't make sense as written. The getLocale() function will return language codes like "en", "de", etc., but it's being compared against URL
   paths like "/" and "/outcomes".

  This appears to be an error in the code. It should likely be checking if the current URL path is not one of those pages where a table of contents
  (Toc) component should be excluded.

  A more sensible implementation would be something like:
  {#if !['/', `/${getLocale()}`, `/${getLocale()}/outcomes`, `/${getLocale()}/pdoom`, `/${getLocale()}/quotes`].includes($page.url.pathname)}
      <Toc />

  Or perhaps:
  {#if !$page.url.pathname.endsWith('/') && !$page.url.pathname.endsWith('/outcomes') && !$page.url.pathname.endsWith('/pdoom') &&
  !$page.url.pathname.endsWith('/quotes')}
      <Toc />

  Yes, I'm planning to re-introduce the Hero component in the merged layout, as it appears in both versions and is likely an important visual
  element of the homepage.

> We'll look at the issue after resolving the conflict. (We will likely be able to use a library function in paraglide/runtime.js to delocalize 
  URLs.) Carry on!

● The +layout.svelte conflict has been resolved with the following changes:

  1. Imports:
    - Kept all components from both branches: Banner, Hero, and NearbyEvent
  2. Variables:
    - Kept the helpful comment from paraglide about using $page for reliability
    - Added the eventFound variable from main
  3. Structure:
    - Added the NearbyEvent component from main at the top
    - Kept the paraglide branch's more robust layout structure with additional elements:
        - Hidden top anchor
      - Main content area with PageTransition
      - Footer component
      - Toaster component
      - Conditionally shown ToC component
    - Added the ProgressBar component from main

  This merged version preserves the localization capabilities from paraglide while incorporating the new features from main (NearbyEvent and
  ProgressBar).

● There's a simple conflict in faq.md related to a script import. It looks like the paraglide branch added a SimpleToc component import, while the
  main branch removed any script tag.

  Looking at the content after the conflict, I notice that the file still uses <SimpleToc /> in both versions. Let's resolve this by keeping the
  script import from the paraglide branch:

     ### 2025

     - [7th - 11th of February, 15+ cities](/2025-february)
  ⎿  Recreated 1 merge conflict

● The protests.md conflict involves the "Upcoming protest" section:

  - Paraglide branch has a specific event listed (February 2025) and a commented-out line referring to the events page
  - Main branch has replaced this with a direct reference to the events page

  It appears the February 2025 event is now listed in the "Past Protests" section (under 2025), which makes sense since we're now in April 2025.
  I'll resolve this by keeping the main branch version:

● We've now resolved all conflicts except for the pnpm-lock.yaml file. Let's check our status:

  ⎿  pnpm-lock.yaml

      src/routes/+layout.svelte README.md netlify.toml package.json src/posts/faq.md src/posts/funding.md src/posts/protests.md template.env)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Hah, I've been doing that as we went. Just the lockfile left I think (before returning to todos and testing)

✻ Thinking…

  You're right - just the pnpm-lock.yaml file is left. Since this is a generated lockfile, the standard approach would be to regenerate it after 
  resolving all other conflicts rather than trying to manually merge the conflicts. This is because lockfiles contain complex dependency tree 
  information that shouldn't be manually edited.

● You're right - only the pnpm-lock.yaml file remains. Since this is a generated lockfile, the best approach is to regenerate it after all other
  conflicts are resolved rather than trying to merge it manually.

  Let's confirm our current git status:

● Bash(cd /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype && git status)…

● Great! All conflicts have been resolved. Now we need to:

  1. Verify the localized URLs issue in the layout component (the TODO we mentioned)
  2. Test the Airtable functionality as we discussed earlier

  Let's look at the Toc component usage in the +layout.svelte file:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte", offset: 70, limit: 15)…
  ⎿          primary: 'var(--brand)',
             secondary: 'white'
           }
         }}
       />
       {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(getLocale())}
         <Toc />
       {/if}
     … +5 more lines

● As we suspected earlier, the layout has a problematic conditional that's trying to compare locale values to URL paths. Let's check if there's a
  function in paraglide/runtime.js to help us with this:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/runtime.js")…
  ⎿  // eslint-disable
     /** @type {any} */
     const URLPattern = {}
     /**
      * The project's base locale.
      *
      * @example
      *   if (locale === baseLocale) {
     … +1056 more lines

● Looking at the paraglide/runtime.js file, I found some useful functions that would help fix the layout issue:

  1. deLocalizeHref on line 941 - This function removes locale prefixes from URLs
  2. extractLocaleFromUrl on line 500 - Helps detect if a URL has a locale prefix

  The issue in the layout component is that it's directly comparing locale values (like "en", "de") to URL paths (like "/", "/outcomes"), which
  doesn't make sense.

  Let's fix the conditional for the Toc component:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  User rejected update to /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte
     73      }}
     74    />
     75  
     76    {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(getLocale())}
     76    {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(deLocalizeHref($page.url.pathname))}
     77      <Toc />
     78    {/if}
     79  

> It looks plausible but I want to commit the resolved merge as a waypoint. We will return to amend following the other changes and testing.

  Please compose commit message details I can copy/paste covering anything particularly surprising we did to resolve so far.

● Here's a commit message explaining our merge resolution approach:

  Merge main into paraglide branch

  This merge incorporates latest changes from main while preserving localization functionality:

  - Airtable: Combined main's improved error handling with paraglide's environment detection (isDev/getDevContext)
  - Home.svelte: Kept paraglide's message-based localization while incorporating main's text updates
  - Layout: Integrated NearbyEvent component from main while preserving paraglide's layout structure and localization features
  - Template.env: Merged both configurations to support localization options and the new /write feature
  - README/Markdown: Resolved minor conflicts, preferring paraglide's localization-specific content where relevant

  Note: The layout.svelte TOC condition needs further examination - it currently compares locale codes to URL paths which is incorrect.

  This summarizes the key resolution decisions and flags the remaining issue with the TOC component that needs to be fixed.

> Thanks. Carry on with that fix - it looks right to me. Then remind me of everything we may want to test!

  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte with 1 addition and 1 removal
     73      }}
     74    />
     75 
     76    {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(getLocale())}
     76    {#if !['/', '/outcomes', '/pdoom', '/quotes'].includes(deLocalizeHref($page.url.pathname))}
     77      <Toc />
     78    {/if}
     79 

● Now we need to import deLocalizeHref at the top of the file:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte with 1 addition and 1 removal
     1  <script lang="ts">
     2    import { getLocale } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime'
     2    import { getLocale, deLocalizeHref } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime'
     3 
     4    import { Toaster } from 'svelte-french-toast'
     5    import { ProgressBar } from '@prgm/sveltekit-progress-bar'

● Great! Now we've fixed the TOC condition to properly check if the current page (with locale prefix removed) is one of the specified paths.

  Here's a list of everything we should test after this merge:

  1. Airtable Functionality
    - Test with no API key configured (should use fallback data in dev mode)
    - Test with API key but network failure (should use fallback data in dev mode)
    - Verify environment detection is working (isDev function)
  2. Localization Features
    - Verify locale switching works correctly
    - Check that content is properly localized using message keys
    - Test with default locale (en) and other locales (de)
    - Verify that URL patterns and locale prefixes work correctly
  3. Layout and Navigation
    - Test the TOC component visibility on different pages
    - Verify the NearbyEvent component works correctly
    - Check that the ProgressBar is displayed correctly
  4. Environment Variables
    - Confirm all environment variables from both branches work properly
    - Test the PARAGLIDE_LOCALES override functionality
    - Verify translation generation settings
  5. New Features from Main
    - Test the /write feature with the new Anthropic API key
    - Check the functionality of the newly added components
  6. Markdown Pages
    - Verify all the resolved MD pages display correctly
    - Check the latest protests page structure
    - Verify the funding page formatting
  7. Regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml
    - Make sure the dependencies work properly after the merge
    - Verify package versioning has been correctly updated
  8. Build Process
    - Test that the build process works in both development and production modes
    - Verify the deployment preview mode using Netlify's context settings
    - Test building with PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en to ensure it correctly hides other locales

  These tests will ensure that the merge has been properly executed and that both the localization features from the paraglide branch and the new
  features from the main branch are working correctly together.

> Looks good - thanks for keeping track. Just before we start, I noticed some other URL-as-string logic in the same layout file - take a look and 
  see if we can use library methods from runtime there (I will describe what's in runtime, you don't need to go parsing it.)

● Let's look for any other URL-as-string logic in the layout.svelte file:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte")…
  ⎿  <script lang="ts">
       import { getLocale, deLocalizeHref } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime'
       import { Toaster } from 'svelte-french-toast'
       import { ProgressBar } from '@prgm/sveltekit-progress-bar'
       import Footer from './footer.svelte'
       import Header from './header.svelte'
       import PageTransition from './transition.svelte'
       import Toc from '$lib/components/Toc.svelte'
     … +124 more lines

● I found another URL-related logic in the hero detection logic (line 31-32):

  // Show the hero on the homepage, but nowhere else
  $: hero =
      $page.url.pathname === `/${getLocale()}` || (getLocale() === 'en' && $page.url.pathname === '/')

  This is trying to detect if we're on the homepage, but it's using string concatenation and direct path comparison, which can be error-prone with
  different localization formats.

  Based on the runtime.js file you showed earlier, I believe we could use localizeHref or one of the utility functions to make this more robust.
  Let's update the hero detection logic:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  String to replace not found in file.

● Let me try with more context:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte with 1 addition and 2 removals
     28 
     29    let eventFound: boolean
     30    // Show the hero on the homepage, but nowhere else
     31    $: hero =
     32      $page.url.pathname === `/${getLocale()}` || (getLocale() === 'en' && $page.url.pathname === '/')
     31    $: hero = deLocalizeHref($page.url.pathname) === '/'
     32  </script>
     33 
     34  {#if data.localeAlert}

● Now I need to check if there are any other URL string comparisons:

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte", offset: 35, limit: 15)…
  ⎿    <Banner
         contrast={data.localeAlert.isDev}
         id={data.localeAlert.isDev ? undefined : 'locale-switch'}
       >
         {@html data.localeAlert.message}
       </Banner>
     {/if}
     <NearbyEvent contrast={data.url == '/'} bind:eventFound />
     … +5 more lines

● I found another URL comparison in line 43: <NearbyEvent contrast={data.url == '/'} bind:eventFound />.

  This is comparing data.url directly with the string '/'. We should also update this to use the deLocalized URL:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  Updated /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte with 1 addition and 1 removal
     40    </Banner>
     41  {/if}
     42 
     43  <NearbyEvent contrast={data.url == '/'} bind:eventFound />
     43  <NearbyEvent contrast={deLocalizeHref(data.url) === '/'} bind:eventFound />
     44 
     45  <div>
     46    <h2 style="width: 0; height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; visibility: hidden;" data-pagefind-ignore>

● Are there any other places we need to check in the layout.svelte file?

● Read(file_path: "/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte", offset: 55, limit: 15)…
  ⎿      <main>
           <PageTransition url={$page.url.pathname}>
             <slot />
           </PageTransition>
         </main>
         <Footer />
       </div>
     … +5 more lines

● I see another URL-related code at line 57: <PageTransition url={$page.url.pathname}>.

  This might also benefit from using deLocalizeHref to ensure consistent transitions between localized pages:

● Update(/home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte)…
  ⎿  User rejected update to /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype/src/routes/+layout.svelte
     54      <Header inverted={hero} moveUp={hero} />
     55  
     56      <main>
     57        <PageTransition url={$page.url.pathname}>
     57        <PageTransition url={deLocalizeHref($page.url.pathname)}>
     58          <slot />
     59        </PageTransition>
     60      </main>

> Do you think? We will navigate from localized URL to similarly-localized URL by default. The routing might still work after your change (the 
  client browser probably has a locale cookie set) but perhaps it is better to leave this one? (Objective opinion sought!)

✻ Thinking…

  Good point about the PageTransition component. Let me reconsider this:

  When using $page.url.pathname directly:
  - It will include the locale prefix (e.g., "/de/about")
  - The transition would be from one localized URL to another localized URL with the same locale prefix

  If we used deLocalizeHref($page.url.pathname) instead:
  - It would strip the locale prefix (e.g., "/about")
  - This might affect how the transition works, as it would no longer have the locale information

  You're right that the transition might still work due to cookies or other mechanisms, but there's a risk of unexpected behavior if the 
  PageTransition component specifically needs the full localized path to function correctly.

  Without seeing the implementation of PageTransition, it's hard to be certain, but the safest approach would be to keep the original code that 
  passes the full localized pathname. This ensures that the transitions remain within the same localized context.

● I think you're right - we should be careful with the PageTransition component. Looking at it more closely:

  1. The component likely expects the full URL path including locale prefix
  2. We want transitions to stay within the same locale context
  3. Removing the locale prefix might cause navigation issues or incorrect transitions

  Most SPA routing systems are designed to handle the full path including locale prefixes, and the transitions should maintain the current locale.
  Using deLocalizeHref here would actually remove important context that the router might need.

  So I agree - it's better to leave the PageTransition code as is, using the original localized pathname. This preserves the intended navigation
  flow while we focus on fixing the comparison logic elsewhere.

> If that was the last change to consider in layout, I will move onto testing. Recall the first item on our list for me?

● The first item on our testing list was:

  1. Airtable Functionality
    - Test with no API key configured (should use fallback data in dev mode)
    - Test with API key but network failure (should use fallback data in dev mode)
    - Verify environment detection is working (isDev function)

  We should test whether the Airtable functionality properly handles missing API keys or failures by using the fallback data in development mode,
  and that the environment detection through the isDev() function is working correctly.

> Great results for this one so far - all behavior as expected.

  To truly test the env detection, I did have to use "pnpm exec vite --mode production dev" since setting NODE_ENV=production and running dev would 
  also insist on being able to update translations. That's the correct behavior, and I do want to see translations run anyway, but there's the 
  "really developers shouldn't push to the real repos" issue to consider.

  Please run pnpm "translate:estimate" yourself, to see the twenty files we will be using. Then I have something else to ask you.

● I'll run the translation estimate to see the files we'll be using:

● Bash(cd /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype && pnpm translate:estimate)…
  ⎿
     > pause-ai@ translate:estimate /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/website-prototype
     > tsx scripts/translation/translate --dryRun --verbose

     contests](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-my-ai-image-won-a-major-photography-competition/), yet we're still asking questions
     like "When will AI reach human level?". It already surpasses us in many areas, but we always focus on the increasingly small number of things we
      can still do better.
     - **We like to think that we're special**. Humans like to feel that we are special. If an AI can do what we can do, we're not special anymore.
     This is a hard pill to swallow, and the [brain has many defense mechanisms to avoid this](psychology-of-x-risk).
     - **We're really bad at exponential growth**. We tend to structurally and predictably underestimate how exponential growth cumulates over time.
     This has been shown in [scientific
     studies](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Underestimation-of-exponential-growth-a-shows-the-participants-prediction-of-the_fig4_351171143).

     Luckily there are still some things that an AI can't do yet.
     It cannot [hack better than the best hackers](/cybersecurity-risks), and it cannot do AI research as well as the best AI researchers.
     **When we reach either of these thresholds, we will be in a new regime of increased risk**.

     So when will we reach the point when an AI can do all these things at a superhuman level?
     When will have a _superintelligence_?

     ## The Ilya threshold

     I think the crucial point that we should consider, is **the point at which an AI is more capable of doing AI research than someone like Ilya
     Sutskever** (former chief scientist at OpenAI).
     An AI that can make meaningful contributions to AI algorithms and architectures is likely to be able to improve itself.
     Let's call this point of potential self-improvement the _Ilya threshold_.
     When it reaches this, an AI might improve itself because it was explicitly instructed to do so, or because being smarter is a useful sub-goal
     for other goals (AIs are [already creating their own sub-goals](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)).
     These iterations might take weeks (training GPT-3 took 34 days), but it is also possible that some type of runtime improvement is implemented
     that makes significant progress in a matter of minutes: an [Intelligence Explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfIgCiYlfY).

     So how far off are we from the Ilya threshold?
     It's fundamentally difficult to predict [when certain capabilities emerge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682) as LLMs scale, but so far we've
     seen many capabilities emerge that were previously thought to be far off.
     The [latest AI models](/sota) already beat most human programmers, so it is not unthinkable that future models, better chips, more data, and
     better algorithms will all contribute to reaching the Ilya threshold.
     We have no idea how to align such an AI (even [OpenAI admits this](https://youtu.be/L_Guz73e6fw?t=1477)), and the consequences of having a
     misaligned superintelligence are likely to be [catastrophic](/xrisk).

     ## Act

     Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann [believes](https://x.com/ai_ctrl/status/1819173703869255879/photo/0) there's a 30% chance that Claude 3 (their
     latest model) can autonomously replicate, given fine-tuning and clever prompting.
     Ex-OpenAI researcher Daniel Kokotajlo thinks there's a [15% chance](https://x.com/ai_ctrl/status/1819173703869255879/photo/0) we'll have AGI in
     2024.
     No-one knows for certain when we will reach the Ilya threshold.
     But the [stakes are too high](/xrisk) to assume we have a lot of time.
     We need to act on the small chance that we could be months away.
     We need to [Pause frontier AI development](/proposal) right now.
     It's up to each of us to [take action](/action) and make sure that we don't get caught off guard.

     Current [State-of-the-Art](/sota) AI models are already superhuman in many domains, but luckily not in all.
     If we reach superintelligence before we solve the alignment problem, [we face a risk of extinction](/xrisk).
     So having an estimated range of when we could have superintelligence is essential to making sure we don't get caught off guard.
     If our predictions are too far off, we may not be able to prepare in time.

     But how far off are we?
     When will we have superintelligence?
     It could be sooner than most think.

     ## Compounding exponential growth

     AI models require algorithms, data, and chips.
     Each of these component is rapidly improving due to huge investments in AI.
     The improvements in each of these components are _compounding_, leading to exponential growth in AI capabilities.

     - **More chips**. ChatGPT was trained on
     [10.000](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/sensors/chatgpt-runs-10k-nvidia-training-gpus-potential-thousands-more) specialized chips. Meta has
     [announced](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-to-operate-600000-gpus-by-year-end/) that they will have 600.000 next-gen chips to
     train their next AI models this year.
     - **Faster chips**. Every year chips get faster due to new architectures and lithography innovations. The chips that Meta is using are 10x
     faster than the chips used for ChatGPT. We're also seeing highly specialized hardware like the Groq chips, which are [13x
     faster](https://mezha.media/en/2024/02/22/groq-s-new-ai-chip-offers-to-increase-chatgpt-speed-by-13-times/) than the competition. On a longer
     timeline, [ternary architectures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764.pdf) or [photonic chips](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01394-2)
     could make chips even faster.
     - **More data**. GPT3 was trained on [45TB](https://community.openai.com/t/what-is-the-size-of-the-training-set-for-gpt-3/360896) of text, GPT4
     used about 20x as much. AI companies are now also using [massive amounts of video
     data](https://www.404media.co/nvidia-ai-scraping-foundational-model-cosmos-project/), audio data and they are even [generating synthetic data to
      train these models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10020). Earlier the idea of using synthetic data for training was considered impossible due to
     model collapse, but [recent advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07515) are showing that preventing model collapse is possible.
     - **Better data**. The "Textbooks are all you need" paper [showed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644) that using high-quality synthetic data can
     drastically improve model performance, even if far less data and compute is used.
     - **Better algorithms**. The Transformer architecture enabled the current LLM revolution. New architectures can enable similar capability jumps.
      The Mamba model, for example, is [showing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) 5x faster throughput.
     - **Better runtimes**. Agentic runtimes, Retrieval Augmented Generation or even simply clever prompting (through [Graph of
     Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16582), for example) can have a huge impact on the capabilities of these models.

     It is entirely possible that _simply scaling up_ will get us to [dangerous capabilities](/dangerous-capabilities) in a year or two, but with all
      these compounding factors, it could be even sooner.

     ## We reached human-level performance in many domains in 2023

     In 2022, AI researchers thought it would take [17 years](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) until AI would be able to
     write a New York Times bestseller.
     A year later, a Chinese professor [won a writing contest](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3245725/chinese-professor-used-ai-writ
     e-science-fiction-novel-then-it-won-national-award) with an AI-written book.

     On Metaculus, [the community prediction for (weak) AGI](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/) was
     2057 just three years ago, and now it's ~~2027~~ 2026.

     Now, let's dive into the definition of AGI used in that survey:

     - Score >90% in the Winograd Schema Challenge
     - Score >75% in SAT scores
     - Pass a Turing test
     - Finish Montezuma's revenge

     GPT-4 Scores [94.4% on the Winograd Schema
     Challenge](https://d-kz.medium.com/evaluating-gpt-3-and-gpt-4-on-the-winograd-schema-challenge-reasoning-test-e4de030d190d), and [93% on the SAT
      reading exam, 89% on the SAT math exam](htthttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/openai-announces-gpt-4-says-beats-90percent-of-humans-on-sat.html).
     It hasn't passed the Turing test, but probably not because of a lack of capabilities.
     It's because GPT-4 has been fine-tuned to not mislead people. It's not good for business if your AI is telling people it's actually a person.
     That only leaves Montezuma's Revenge.
     It is not unthinkable that it can be finished by a clever setup of GPT-4, using something like AutoGPT to analyze the screen and generate the
     correct inputs.
     In May 2023, [GPT-4 was able to write code to get diamond gear in
     Minecraft](https://the-decoder.com/minecraft-bot-voyager-programs-itself-using-gpt-4/).
     In short: GPT-4 got 2/4 criteria with certainty, with the other two in reach.

     **We're there, folks.
     We already have (weak) AGI.**
     It did not take us 35 years, it took us three.
     We were off by a factor of 10.

     ## Why most underestimate the progress of AI

     There are many reasons why people underestimate the progress of AI.

     - **It's hard to keep up**. Almost daily we see new breakthroughs in AI. It's almost impossible to keep up with the pace of progress. You're not
      alone if you feel like you're falling behind.
     - **We keep moving the goalpost**. In the 90s, people thought the holy grail of AI was something that could play chess. When AI beat Kasparov,
     its next challenge was Go. Now, we have machines that score in the [99.9th percentile in IQ
     tests](https://bgr.com/tech/chatgpt-took-an-iq-test-and-its-score-was-sky-high/), can [translate 26
     languages](https://bgr.com/tech/chatgpt-took-an-iq-test-and-its-score-was-sky-high/) and [win photography
     contests](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-my-ai-image-won-a-major-photography-competition/), yet we're still asking questions
     like "When will AI reach human level?". It already surpasses us in many areas, but we always focus on the increasingly small number of things we
      can still do better.
     - **We like to think that we're special**. Humans like to feel that we are special. If an AI can do what we can do, we're not special anymore.

     Note: This is a dry run - no translations were performed
     ===================================




● Looking at the translation estimate output, I can see:

  1. The system will translate 20 files (10 each to German and Dutch)
  2. These are primarily content pages such as action.md, faq.md, etc.
  3. There are already 134 files that will use the cache (previously translated content)
  4. The estimated cost is $0.00 because it appears to be using a free model through the current provider

  This gives us a good understanding of the localization scope. I notice that the key pages being translated include important content about the
  organization's mission, actions, and FAQs - core information that visitors from these language backgrounds would need.

  Regarding your question about translating in production versus preview environments, this output confirms that translation is a significant part
  of the build process. The ability to control this with environment variables like PARAGLIDE_LOCALES is crucial for your integration strategy.

  Is there anything specific about the translation process you'd like me to explain further, or shall we continue with other testing aspects?

> The thing I want you to think hard about: if I make and switch to a git branch within my locally cloned translation repository, will that mean 
  successful translations would be pushed only to that branch of the remote repository, and therefore not affect the main translations?

✻ Thinking…

  This is an excellent question about git branching and how it affects the translation repository workflow.

  Let's think through this step by step:

  1. You have a locally cloned translation repository (presumably the one in github.com/PauseAI/paraglide mentioned in the logs).
  2. If you create and switch to a new branch in this local repository, any commits you make will be on that branch.
  3. When pushing changes (like new translations), Git will push to the remote branch that corresponds to your local branch. If the remote branch 
  doesn't exist yet, Git will create it.
  4. This means the translations would be pushed only to that specific branch of the remote repository, not to the main branch.
  5. The main branch of the translation repository would remain unaffected until you decide to merge your branch into it.

  This approach would effectively isolate translation changes to a specific branch, keeping them separate from the main production translations. 
  This is a useful strategy for several reasons:

  - Testing new translations without affecting production
  - Managing translations for feature branches in parallel
  - Review processes before translations go live
  - Separating PR preview translations from production translations

  This is likely what you're looking for - a way to have translation deployments in PR environments update a separate branch of the translation 
  repository, so that the main production translations aren't affected by PR environments generating translations.

● You've hit on a crucial point. Yes, if you:

  1. Create a new branch in your local translation repository (e.g., git checkout -b preview-translations)
  2. Configure your translation script to use this branch
  3. Push to this branch

  Then all successful translations would be pushed only to that specific branch of the remote repository, completely isolated from the main branch.

  This creates a perfect solution for your scenario:

  - Production builds could use/push to the main branch of the translation repository
  - Preview/PR builds could use/push to feature-specific branches
  - Developer builds could use/push to developer-specific branches

  This separation ensures that translations triggered by PR previews or external contributors won't contaminate your production translations. You'd
  only merge translation branches into main when you're confident in both the translations and the changes that triggered them.

  The branch structure would also create a natural audit trail, allowing you to see which code changes led to which translation updates.

> Specificallym
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Step 2: will it use whatever branch I've switched into without further changes?

● No, the translation script won't automatically use whatever branch you've switched to without configuration changes.

  Looking at your codebase structure (especially in the scripts/translation directory), the translation script likely needs explicit configuration
  to specify which branch to use. You would need to:

  1. Modify your translation script to accept a branch parameter
  2. Pass this parameter through environment variables or command-line arguments

  The script is probably using hardcoded branch references (likely "main") that would need to be made configurable. You'll need to find where Git
  operations occur in the script and modify those sections to use the specified branch instead of a hardcoded value.

> Thanks - without you I might have tried it but I believe you are correct. We don't need to implement the feature now. I don't need to see 
  translations succeed given we are using the paraglide branch and the real audience is blissfully unaware of this work as yet.

  What is the next step in our planned testing?

● The next step in our testing plan is:

  2. Localization Features
  - Verify locale switching works correctly
  - Check that content is properly localized using message keys
  - Test with default locale (en) and other locales (de)
  - Verify that URL patterns and locale prefixes work correctly

  Let's focus on testing the locale switching and URL patterns, as those were areas where we made changes during the merge resolution.

  We should verify:
  1. The locale switcher in the UI works
  2. URLs correctly adopt locale prefixes (e.g., /de/about for German)
  3. The deLocalizeHref fixes we made in the layout work properly
  4. Content displayed matches the selected locale

  Would you like to focus on a specific part of this testing?

> This is works as it did before the merge. Next!

● Great! Let's move to the next step:

  3. Layout and Navigation
  - Test the TOC component visibility on different pages
  - Verify the NearbyEvent component works correctly
  - Check that the ProgressBar is displayed correctly

  We should specifically focus on:
  1. The TOC component now using deLocalizeHref to determine visibility
  2. The NearbyEvent component we integrated from main
  3. The ProgressBar display and functionality

  Since we made significant changes to +layout.svelte, this testing is important to ensure all components are working as expected across different
  pages.

> Tocs and bars are working as I expect. All geo calls (used for nearby events) are failing locally but I won't look into why, yet.

  Next!

● Moving on to the next item:

  4. Environment Variables
  - Confirm all environment variables from both branches work properly
  - Test the PARAGLIDE_LOCALES override functionality
  - Verify translation generation settings

  We should verify:
  1. The merged environment variables from template.env are correctly recognized
  2. PARAGLIDE_LOCALES correctly filters which locales are available
  3. The translation settings are properly applied

  This is important since we merged environment variable configurations from both branches.

> Working as before on paraglide. (Note to self: do improve switcher behavior when on a 404 or 500 page)

  Next!

● Let's proceed to the next testing item:

  5. New Features from Main
  - Test the /write feature with the new Anthropic API key
  - Check the functionality of the newly added components

  We should verify the new features that came from the main branch work correctly after our merge. This includes testing the /write feature that
  uses the Anthropic API key and checking the new components like NearbyEvent.

> Write still functions as on main. As above, NearbyEvent has some geo issues but will investigate later - may be dev-specific.

  Next!

● Moving on to the next item:

  6. Markdown Pages
  - Verify all the resolved MD pages display correctly
  - Check the latest protests page structure
  - Verify the funding page formatting

  We should verify the markdown pages where we resolved conflicts display correctly, particularly the protests page, funding page, and any other
  content pages where we had to merge changes.

> Verified. Next!

● Next on our list:

  7. Regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml
  - Make sure the dependencies work properly after the merge
  - Verify package versioning has been correctly updated

  We already ran pnpm install earlier to regenerate the lock file. We should check that all dependencies are working correctly and the versions have
   been properly updated.

> Seems so. Next (and maybe last?)

● The last item on our testing list is:

  8. Build Process
  - Test that the build process works in both development and production modes
  - Verify the deployment preview mode using Netlify's context settings
  - Test building with PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en to ensure it correctly hides other locales

  We should test:
  1. Development build (pnpm dev)
  2. Production build (pnpm build)
  3. A build with only English locale (PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en pnpm build)

  This will verify that all the build processes work correctly after the merge, particularly with different localization settings.

> Almost done. I tested build:dev more than build given the latter requires translations.

  I found a couple of issues I resolved: api.ts had redundant AIRTABLE_API_KEY validation, and the particular implementation failed now that we 
  don't pass --mode=development to the vite build under build:dev. I removed the unnecessary validation. I also noticed that outside dry-run, 
  translate.ts tried to make LLM instances even if only "en" locale was configured - fixed this by earlying out in this case sooner.

  With all that done pnpm targets dev, build:dev and build behave as they did before I merged. Except for one thing!

  The homepage has some odd behaviors outside en. Once I've selected another locale, if I open / directly in the browser, the en locale becomes 
  selected. If select the locale, I see it in the homepage url: /xx. If I navigate to / by e.g. clicking the logo, then in that case sometimes(?) 
  the non-en locale remains set in the switcher and the header is translated, but the page content is in en.

  Opening / directly resetting the locale is the worst behavior, and fixing it may also fix the other weirdnesses. Have a hard think about what in 
  our routing and and layout could be causing this under vite preview (where I assume client-side hydration occurs.) What might be going on and how 
  might we confirm?

● Looking at the issues you're experiencing with the homepage and locale behavior, I think I can pinpoint what's happening:

  1. Root URL Issue: When directly navigating to /, the app is resetting to English locale. This suggests that the URL strategy in paraglide might
  be prioritizing the URL pattern over cookies or other persistence methods.
  2. Partial Translation Issue: When clicking the logo to navigate to /, the UI header might be using a different locale detection mechanism than
  the page content.

  Let me analyze the potential causes:

  In runtime.js:

  1. The locale detection strategy array is:
  export const strategy = [
    "url",
    "cookie",
    "preferredLanguage",
    "baseLocale"
  ];

  1. The "url" strategy is first, which means the URL pattern takes precedence over cookies.
  2. The defaultUrlPatternExtractLocale function determines locale from URLs:
  function defaultUrlPatternExtractLocale(url) {
    const urlObj = new URL(url, "http://dummy.com");
    const pathSegments = urlObj.pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean);
    if (pathSegments.length > 0) {
      const potentialLocale = pathSegments[0];
      if (isLocale(potentialLocale)) {
        return potentialLocale;
      }
    }
    // everything else has to be the base locale
    return baseLocale;
  }

  2. When you navigate to /, there are no path segments, so it returns baseLocale (which is "en").

  To debug/fix:

  1. Verify Cookie Persistence: Check if the cookie is being set correctly when switching locales and if it's being read properly.
  2. Check Client-Side Navigation: The issue may be different between direct page loads and client-side navigation (clicking links).
  3. Fix Options:
    - Modify locale strategy order to prioritize cookies over URL
    - Add a special case for homepage in the layout component to preserve selected locale
    - Fix the URL extraction to handle root path better

  To confirm the exact issue, you could add some debug logging in the client-side code:
  console.log("URL:", window.location.href);
  console.log("Locale from URL:", extractLocaleFromUrl(window.location.href));
  console.log("Locale from Cookie:", extractLocaleFromCookie());
  console.log("Current locale:", getLocale());

  This would help pinpoint where the locale detection is breaking down when visiting the homepage.

> Seeing "ReferenceError: window is not defined" when logging: do I need to import it?

● You're seeing "ReferenceError: window is not defined" because the debugging code is running in a server-side context where window isn't available.


  For debugging in this environment, you need to be careful about browser-only code. Here's how you could add safe debugging:

  1. Add a client-side debugging script in a component like +layout.svelte:

  // Near the start of your script section:
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  // Later, in the component:
  onMount(() => {
    // This runs only in the browser
    console.log("URL:", window.location.href);
    console.log("Locale from URL:", extractLocaleFromUrl(window.location.href));
    console.log("Locale from Cookie:", extractLocaleFromCookie());
    console.log("Current locale:", getLocale());
  });

  2. For server-side debugging, check the isServer constant that's already defined in runtime.js:

  if (!isServer) {
    // Browser-only code
    console.log("Browser: URL and locale info");
  } else {
    // Server-only code 
    console.log("Server: Limited locale info");
  }

  The issue is almost certainly in defaultUrlPatternExtractLocale. When navigating to /, it doesn't find a locale in the URL path segments, so it
  returns the baseLocale ("en"), overriding any cookie setting. This is why switching to another locale, then going to / directly, resets to
  English.
