Thanks for all your help.

I'd like to end this session.
Remember how we started?
Please help create two summaries of our session.
Another instance of you will be reading the first.

1. Technical Summary (notes/summary/[timestamp].[chatname].summary.md):
   - Focus on concrete decisions and outcomes
   - Separate exploration/rationale from conclusions
   - Document status and next steps
   - Keep implementation details precise

2. Personal Notes (notes/personal/[timestamp].[chatname].personal.md):
   - Capture learning journey and insights
   - Note process improvements and tool interactions
   - Record meta observations about the session
   - Track workflow evolution

I already ran a shell script to handle chat extraction and file creation, and I've attached the raw text.
Focus on organizing and summarizing the content of this chat effectively.
