● Summary: Current Project Status

  L10n Infrastructure: COMPLETE & Ready for Production ✅

  The pauseai-l10n project has reached a major milestone. The core localization infrastructure is fully implemented with:

  - Branch Safety System: Prevents accidental production cache writes, with CI exceptions
  - Mode System: Automatic detection of en-only/dry-run/perform modes based on environment
  - Link Localization: Automatic internal link localization via custom a.svelte component
  - Force Mode: Glob pattern support for selective retranslation
  - Comprehensive Testing: 46 passing tests across 4 test files
  - Clean Architecture: 3 atomic commits ready for merge to main

  Current Priority: Write comprehensive documentation and merge to main, then return to investigating the 500 edge function errors that were
  discovered during en-prefix implementation.

  Working Directory: /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10n/notes/references/pauseai-website/ (NOT the top-level directory)

  Environment Information

  Working directory: /home/anthony/repos/pauseai-l10nIs directory a git repo: YesPlatform: linuxOS Version: Linux 6.11.0-26-genericToday's date:
  6/11/2025Current branch: claude-the-project-is-in-notes/references/pauseai-website

  The project uses LLM-based translation with Git-managed caching, targeting a SvelteKit website with Paraglide localization. The implementation
  prioritizes avoiding duplicate LLM calls through comprehensive caching and maintains full audit trails of translation decisions.

  Ready to assist with the next phase of development!

> Yes. We want to update developer-facing documentation. We'll start from README.md - but we might separate an overview of l10n and how one can use 
  different modes for it when developing (with the default en-only - and also some fall-backs for dynamic pages needing other dependencie - being 
  what you get without an environment.) template.env is used to define and document .env details for both l10n and other dynamics. Documentation 
  should put pnpm targets front and center.

  We aim to amend recent unpushed commits in light of the documentation and flesh out a few of their defaults. So at some point you'll want to look 
  at the code changes in each unpushed commit for most context.

  Think that sounds plausible? Outline the documentation changes you propose in abstract.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to update developer-facing documentation, starting with README.md. They want to:

  1. Document the l10n system and different modes (en-only default, dry-run, perform)
  2. Document fallbacks for dynamic pages that need other dependencies
  3. Use template.env to document .env details for both l10n and other dynamics
  4. Put pnpm targets front and center in documentation
  5. Potentially separate l10n overview into its own section
  6. Review recent unpushed commits to understand what needs documenting
  7. Amend recent unpushed commits based on documentation insights

  Let me first understand the current state by looking at the working directory and examining the current README.md and template.env files, then 
  look at recent commits.

● Yes, that sounds very plausible! Let me first examine the current documentation state and recent commits to propose a concrete outline.

  document:

● Read(scripts/l10n/mode.ts)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a clear picture. Let me propose a comprehensive documentation update plan based on what I've learned:

  1. Current README.md is quite basic and doesn't document the new l10n infrastructure at all
  2. The template.env mentions old environment variable names (TRANSLATION_OPENROUTER_API_KEY instead of L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  3. The pnpm targets include key commands like l10n, dev, build, test that need proper documentation
  4. The recent commits added three major features that need documentation:
    - Branch safety system
    - Mode system (en-only/dry-run/perform)
    - Force mode with glob patterns

  Let me propose a structured outline.

● Proposed Documentation Update Outline

  Based on examining the current state and recent commits, here's what I propose:

  1. README.md Complete Overhaul

  Current Problem: README is basic and doesn't document the sophisticated l10n system at all

  Proposed Structure:
  # PauseAI.info Website

  ## Quick Start
  - Basic clone & run (pnpm dev)
  - Links to deployment status

  ## Development Commands (pnpm targets front & center)
  - pnpm dev (default en-only mode)
  - pnpm build
  - pnpm l10n [--dry-run] [--force] [--verbose]
  - pnpm test
  - pnpm clean
  - Development vs production preview modes

  ## Localization (L10n) System
  ### Overview & Modes
  - en-only (default): Fast development, no translations
  - dry-run (fallback): Uses cached translations, no LLM calls
  - perform: Full translation with LLM + cache updates

  ### Developer Setup
  - Environment configuration (.env from template.env)
  - Branch safety (can't write to main from local dev)
  - Cache repository (l10n-cage) setup

  ### Advanced L10n Usage
  - Force retranslation (glob patterns)
  - Branch-specific translation testing
  - CI vs local development differences

  ## Content Creation (move existing CMS section here)

  ## Dynamic Features & API Keys
  - AirTable integration
  - OpenAI/Anthropic API usage
  - Fallback behaviors when APIs unavailable

  2. template.env Updates

  Current Problem: Uses old environment variable names and doesn't document the new l10n system properly

  Proposed Changes:
  - Update TRANSLATION_OPENROUTER_API_KEY → L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  - Add L10N_BRANCH documentation
  - Explain the three l10n modes clearly
  - Document fallback behaviors

  3. Separate L10n Developer Guide (Optional)

  Create docs/L10N_DEVELOPMENT.md for comprehensive l10n documentation:
  - Complete mode system explanation
  - Branch safety rationale & implementation
  - Cache architecture (l10n-cage)
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Contributing translations

  4. Review Recent Commits for Documentation Gaps

  Based on the 3 atomic commits:
  - Document new CLI flags (--dry-run, --force, --verbose)
  - Explain glob pattern support for force mode
  - Document branch safety behavior
  - Update any hardcoded examples or defaults

  5. Package.json Script Documentation

  Ensure all pnpm targets have clear descriptions and the README explains when to use each one.

  Questions for you:
  1. Do you want the comprehensive l10n docs in README.md or separated into docs/L10N_DEVELOPMENT.md?
  2. Should I examine each commit's changes in detail before writing docs, or start with the general structure?
  3. Are there specific aspects of the mode system or branch safety that developers commonly get confused about?

  This approach puts pnpm targets front and center while providing the comprehensive l10n documentation that's currently missing. The structure
  supports both "just want to run the site" developers and those working with translations.

> 1. The latter - a developer who doesn't need to care should need to read only README.md. Basics of environment set up, CMS and key targets stay in
   README.md and most l10n details are in a linked L10N.md document.
  2. I suspect knowing some commit details will help. Look also for more clues in the v2 plan document. Also, ask me about ambiguities rather than 
  searching too widely - I can probably point at what code or summaries you need to read.
  3. We don't know yet! I'll roleplay both a brand new developer, and one who hazily understood the l10n prototype's older approaches.

● Perfect! Let me examine the recent commits and the v2 plan document to understand the implementation details better before drafting the
  documentation.

  Question: I see the template.env still uses TRANSLATION_OPENROUTER_API_KEY. Should I update this to L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY to match the code
  changes? Also, I notice there's no L10N_BRANCH variable documented in template.env - should I add it?

> We want everyone to talk about localizations (l10ns) rather than translations. Start by explaining how translating into a language is a large

      7  ## What is Localization (L10n)?
      8  
      9  Localization goes beyond simple translation—it adapts content for specific locales (e.g., `en-US`, `de-DE`, `nl-NL`). While translating te
        xt between languages is a major part of l10n, true localization also considers cultural context, regional preferences, and local convention
        s. This project uses LLMs to automatically generate locale-appropriate content.

● Now let me continue updating the README to add a Quick Start section and reorganize for developer clarity:

● Update(README.md)
  ⎿  User rejected update to README.md
      60  
      61  For comprehensive l10n documentation, see [L10N.md](./L10N.md).
      62  
      63  ## Quick Start
      64  
      65  ```bash
      66  # Clone the repository
      67  git clone git@github.com:PauseAI/pauseai-website.git
      68  cd pauseai-website
      69  
      70  # Install dependencies (we use pnpm, but npm or yarn also work)
      71  pnpm install
      72  
      73  # Start development server (en-only mode by default)
      74  pnpm dev
      75  
      76  # Open http://localhost:37572
      77  ```
      78  
      79  That's it! The development server runs in English-only mode by default for maximum speed. No API keys or special setup required.
      80  
      81  ## Development Commands
      82  
      83  | Command | Description |
      84  |---------|-------------|
      85  | `pnpm dev` | Start development server (en-only mode) |
      86  | `pnpm build` | Build for production with full l10n |
      87  | `pnpm preview` | Preview production build locally |
      88  | `pnpm test` | Run test suite |
      89  | `pnpm lint` | Check code style |
      90  | `pnpm format` | Auto-fix code style |
      91  | `pnpm clean` | Clean build artifacts and caches |
      92  | `pnpm l10n` | Run l10n manually (see [L10N.md](./L10N.md)) |
      93  | `pnpm netlify` | Show Netlify preview options |
      94  
      95  ## Environment Setup
      96  
      97  For dynamic features and l10n development:
      98  
      99  ```bash
     100  cp template.env .env
     101  # Edit .env to add API keys as needed
     102  ```
     103  
     104  See `template.env` for detailed documentation of each variable. Key points:
     105  - **No `.env` needed** for basic development
     106  - **Dynamic content** (teams, chat, write features) needs API keys
     107  - **L10n development** needs OpenRouter API key and cache setup
     108  
     109  For comprehensive l10n documentation, see [L10N.md](./L10N.md).
     110  
     111  ## Creating Articles

> Hmmm. The en-only default with missing environment exists for dev, but does that also apply outside of CI? I think it probably should, but 
  doesn't. Investigate and respond with an opinionated plan.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about whether the en-only default applies outside of CI (i.e., in production builds when not in CI). Let me investigate how the
   locale configuration works in different environments.

  I need to check:
  1. How PARAGLIDE_LOCALES is handled in different environments
  2. What the defaults are in dev vs build vs production
  3. Whether the en-only default is consistent across all non-CI environments

  Let me look at the relevant code to understand the current behavior.

● Good catch! Let me investigate how locale defaults work across different environments:

● Search(pattern: "PARAGLIDE_LOCALES", include: "*.js,*.ts,*.json")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check these files to understand how PARAGLIDE_LOCALES is handled in different environments.

● Read(scripts/inlang-settings.ts)
  ⎿  Read 146 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I see that the settings generation uses possiblyOverriddenLocales() from src/lib/env.ts. Let me check that file to understand how it determines 
  the locales in different environments.

● Read(src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  Read 75 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I see the issue! Looking at line 63:

  const envValue = (env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES || (isDev() ? 'en' : 'all')).trim()

  This means:
  - If PARAGLIDE_LOCALES is not set:
    - In dev environments (isDev() = true): defaults to 'en'
    - In production environments (isDev() = false): defaults to 'all'

  So the en-only default ONLY applies when isDev() returns true. Let me check what isDev() considers as dev:

  From lines 24-29:
  - It checks NODE_ENV or MODE
  - If neither is set, or if they are 'development' or 'test', or if DEV=true, then it's considered dev
  - Production builds (NODE_ENV=production) would NOT get the en-only default!

  This is a problem because:
  1. When running pnpm build locally without a .env file, it would try to build ALL locales
  2. This would fail because there's no L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY set
  3. The user would be confused why a simple build doesn't work

  Let me also check how the build process sets NODE_ENV:

● Read(package.json)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The build command sets NODE_ENV=production, which means isDev() returns false, which means the default 
  becomes 'all' locales instead of 'en'.

  This creates a confusing developer experience:
  - pnpm dev works fine (defaults to en-only)
  - pnpm build fails unless you have a .env file or API keys set up

  This is inconsistent and violates the principle of least surprise.

● Investigation Results & Opinionated Plan

  Current Behavior:
  - pnpm dev: Defaults to en only (via isDev() check)
  - pnpm build: Defaults to all locales because NODE_ENV=production makes isDev() return false
  - This means developers can't build locally without setting up a .env file!

  The Problem: The en-only default is tied to isDev() rather than "do I have l10n infrastructure set up?" This creates an inconsistent experience
  where pnpm dev works out-of-the-box but pnpm build doesn't.

  My Opinionated Plan

  Principle: Zero-config development should work for ALL commands, not just pnpm dev.

  Proposed Changes:

  1. Change the default logic in src/lib/env.ts:
  // OLD: 
  const envValue = (env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES || (isDev() ? 'en' : 'all')).trim()

  // NEW:
  const envValue = (env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES || (env.CI ? 'all' : 'en')).trim()
  2. Rationale:
    - Local development (dev/build/preview) defaults to en unless explicitly configured
    - CI/CD environments default to all locales (they have the API keys)
    - Developers explicitly opt-in to multi-locale development via .env
  3. Documentation Updates:
    - README: "All commands work with zero config in en-only mode"
    - template.env: Clear explanation that PARAGLIDE_LOCALES controls both dev AND build
    - L10N.md: Detailed explanation of the defaults
  4. Alternative Considered (but rejected):
    - We could check for API key presence, but that couples build configuration to l10n generation capability
    - Better to have a simple rule: "CI gets all locales, local gets en-only unless configured"

  This makes the developer experience consistent and predictable:
  - Clone repo → Any command works immediately
  - Want l10n? → Set up .env file
  - Production? → CI handles it automatically

  What do you think? Should I implement this change?

> Yes, that sounds ideal. After we've made the code changes we will want to amend (probably one?) unpushed commit with them.
  ⎿  ☒ Review recent commits and v2 plan for implementation details

     62    const env = getEnvironment()
     63    const envValue = (env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES || (isDev() ? 'en' : 'all')).trim()
     63    // Default to 'en' for local development, 'all' for CI environments
     64    const envValue = (env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES || (env.CI ? 'all' : 'en')).trim()
     65    const listedLocales = envValue.replace(/all|-/g, ',')
     66    const inclusive = listedLocales === envValue
     67    const namedLocales = listedLocales.split(',').map((locale: string) => locale.trim())
     ...
     69    )
     70    if (!result.includes('en')) result.push('en')
     71    //	console.debug(`defaults: ${JSON.stringify(defaults)}`)
     72    //	console.log(`PARAGLIDE_LOCALES: ${env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES} (${getDevContext()}) => envValue: ${envValue} => result: ${result}`)
     72    //	console.log(`PARAGLIDE_LOCALES: ${env.PARAGLIDE_LOCALES} (CI: ${env.CI}) => envValue: ${envValue} => result: ${result}`)
     73    return result
     74  }

> I think you'll want to make an analogous change in airtable.ts and then all getDevContext use is gone. Perhaps keep that method but change it's 
  implementation to report both CI and isDev?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is right - I should look for all uses of getDevContext() and update them appropriately. They're suggesting that I should update 
  airtable.ts to use CI detection instead of isDev(), and then update getDevContext() to report both CI and isDev status.

● Excellent point! Let me find all uses of getDevContext() and update them:

● Search(pattern: "getDevContext\(\)", include: "*.ts,*.js,*.svelte")

  Let me look at airtable.ts to see how it's using getDevContext and isDev:

● Read(src/lib/airtable.ts)
  ⎿  Read 83 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I see. In airtable.ts, it's using isDev() to decide whether to use fallback data when the API key is missing or there's an error. This is actually
   a reasonable use of isDev() - it's about development convenience, not about CI/production distinction.

  However, the logging with getDevContext() could be improved to show both CI and isDev status.

  Let me update getDevContext() to report both:

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I've updated getDevContext() to show both CI and isDev status. Now I should update the inlang-settings.ts to use getDevContext() again since
   it now shows the CI status:

● Update(scripts/inlang-settings.ts)
  ⎿  Error: No changes to make: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

✻ Thinking…

  The code in inlang-settings.ts already uses getDevContext(), which is perfect since it will now show both CI and isDev status.

  Let me quickly verify that we're done with all the changes:
  1. ✅ Changed possiblyOverriddenLocales to use CI detection instead of isDev()
  2. ✅ Updated getDevContext() to show both CI and isDev status
  3. ✅ airtable.ts continues to use isDev() appropriately for fallback data (no change needed)
  4. ✅ inlang-settings.ts already uses getDevContext() which now shows CI status

  I should mark this task as complete and identify which commit needs to be amended.
  ⎿  ☒ Review recent commits and v2 plan for implementation details
     ☒ Fix locale default logic to use CI detection instead of isDev()

     ☐ Create comprehensive L10N.md documentation
     ☐ Review and amend commits based on documentation needs

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check which commit this change belongs to. Since it's in src/lib/env.ts and src/lib/l10n.ts was touched in the mode system commit, it 
  likely belongs there:

● Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch l10-preview

       (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

✻ Thinking…

  Good! The change to src/lib/env.ts should be amended into the mode system commit (6d18e4f) since that's where the L10N_CAGE_DIR constant was added
   to src/lib/l10n.ts, and it's logically part of the mode system improvements.

  Let me also check if there are changes in README.md that need to be saved:

● Bash(git diff README.md)
  ⎿  diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
     index cab3163..9a2e8cd 100644

     … +14 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I've started updating the README. Let me continue with a complete rewrite based on our plan. But first, let me stage and commit the env.ts 
  changes to be amended later:

● Bash(git add src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

● Bash(git commit -m "fix: change locale defaults to use CI detection instead of isDev()")
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> I don't think airtable should use isDev with the common implementation: that will make the default production builds fail on a developer machine 
  without keys. Really I think we want to leave all isDev and getDevContext clients alone, and switch their implemenations over to (opposite of) CI.

✻ Thinking…

  You're absolutely right! The issue is that with my proposed change, a local pnpm build would fail because:
  1. isDev() returns false in production builds (NODE_ENV=production)
  2. But we're not in CI, so the Airtable code would throw an error when the API key is missing

  The user is suggesting we keep all the existing isDev() logic intact but change the implementation of isDev() itself to be based on CI detection 
  rather than NODE_ENV. That way:
  - Local development (any command) = isDev() returns true = fallback data works
  - CI builds = isDev() returns false = requires API keys

  This is a much cleaner solution that doesn't require changing any calling code.

● You're absolutely right! That's a much cleaner approach. Let me revert my env.ts changes and implement it correctly:

● Bash(git checkout -- src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  (No content)

✻ Thinking…

  The file was reverted. Now I need to change the implementation of isDev() to be based on CI detection instead of NODE_ENV. This way all existing 
  code that uses isDev() will work correctly - treating local builds as "dev" regardless of NODE_ENV.

● Now let me change the isDev() implementation to use CI detection:

● Update(src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  (No changes)

  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+r to expand)

  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I see import.meta.env.DEV is used in the markdown loading fallback. This is Vite's built-in development mode flag. Let me check if we're setting
  env.DEV anywhere:

● Search(pattern: ""DEV=|DEV:|process\.env\.DEV"")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(src/routes/+layout.ts)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I don't see any code setting process.env.DEV. It appears env.DEV in our old isDev() check was meant to catch Vite's import.meta.env.DEV, but since
   our getEnvironment() function handles both browser and Node contexts, it should work.

  However, you raise a good point. We should probably respect env.DEV as an override. Here's my thinking:

  1. Primary behavior: Use CI detection (env.CI !== 'true')
  2. Override: But if env.DEV is explicitly set to true, treat as dev mode regardless

  This gives us the best of both worlds:
  - Zero-config works correctly (local = dev, CI = prod)
  - But developers can force dev mode with DEV=true if needed

  Would you like me to implement this hybrid approach?

● Now let's look at which commit this change should be part of. It seems like it belongs with the mode system commit since it affects how the system
   determines its operating mode:

● Bash(git diff src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  diff --git a/src/lib/env.ts b/src/lib/env.ts
     index 44fd6b7..76acf33 100644
     --- a/src/lib/env.ts
     +++ b/src/lib/env.ts
     … +50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! This change makes the behavior consistent:
  1. By default, isDev() returns true for local development (CI not set) and false in CI
  2. This makes all commands (dev/build/preview) default to en-only mode locally
  3. But respects explicit DEV=true override if needed
  4. The logging clearly shows what's driving the decision

  This should be added to the mode system commit (6d18e4f) since it's part of how the system determines its operating mode. Should I proceed with
  updating the README and other documentation now?

> I disagree. That commit currently builds machinery but doesn't use it. Now it would change live behavior. A later commit starts integrating new 
  logic for real: this change should be in that.

  (Side note: I have confirmed that all tests still pass. But we probably don't need a new case just for env.DEV overriding env.CI.))

● You're absolutely right! The mode system commit (6d18e4f) just adds the new machinery without changing any behavior. This env.ts change actually
  changes live behavior, so it belongs in a later commit that integrates the new logic.

  Let me check which commit that would be:

● The 7a4cdbc commit is where the new features are actually integrated. That's where our env.ts change belongs since it changes the default
  behavior.

  Let me save this change for later and continue with the documentation. First, let me complete the README update:
  ⎿  ☒ Review recent commits and v2 plan for implementation details

     ☐ Review and amend commits based on documentation needs
     ☐ Stage env.ts changes for commit 7a4cdbc when amending

        xt between languages is a major part of l10n, true localization also considers cultural context, regional preferences, and local convention
        s. This project uses LLMs to automatically generate locale-appropriate content.

     11  ## Quick Start
     12  
     13  ```bash
     14  # Clone the repository
     15  git clone git@github.com:PauseAI/pauseai-website.git
     16  cd pauseai-website
     17  
     18  # Install dependencies (we use pnpm, but npm or yarn also work)
     19  pnpm install
     20  
     21  # Start development server (en-only mode)
     22  pnpm dev
     23  
     24  # Open http://localhost:37572
     25  ```
     26  
     27  That's it! By default, all commands run in English-only mode for maximum speed. No API keys or special setup required.
     28  
     29  ## Development Commands
     30  
     31  | Command | Description |
     32  |---------|-------------|
     33  | `pnpm dev` | Start development server |
     34  | `pnpm build` | Build for production |
     35  | `pnpm preview` | Preview production build |
     36  | `pnpm test` | Run test suite |
     37  | `pnpm lint` | Check code style |
     38  | `pnpm format` | Auto-fix code style |
     39  | `pnpm clean` | Clean build artifacts and caches |
     40  | `pnpm l10n` | Run l10n manually (see [L10N.md](./L10N.md)) |
     41  | `pnpm netlify` | Show Netlify preview options |
     42  
     43  **Note**: All commands default to English-only mode unless you configure multiple locales in `.env`.
     44  
     45  ## Environment Setup
     46  
     47  For dynamic features and l10n development:
     48  
     49  ```bash
     50  cp template.env .env
     51  # Edit .env to add API keys and configure locales
     52  ```
     53  
     54  See `template.env` for detailed documentation of each variable:
     55  - **No `.env` needed** for basic development
     56  - **Dynamic content** (teams, chat, write features) needs API keys but has fallbacks
     57  - **Multiple locales** needs `PARAGLIDE_LOCALES` configuration
     58  - **L10n development** also needs OpenRouter API key
     59  
     60  For comprehensive l10n documentation, see [L10N.md](./L10N.md).
     61  
     62  ## Creating Articles
     63 
     64  You can create and edit most content using [Decap CMS](https://pauseai-cms.netlify.app/), a user-friendly web interface for managing conte

       2  
       3  This guide covers the complete l10n system for developers working on the PauseAI website.
       4  
       3  ## Overview
       4  
       5  The l10n system automatically generates locale-appropriate content using LLMs. It operates in different modes based on your environment, 
     tries to stay dormant in default development, and provides safety mechanisms to prevent accidental overwrites of production content.
         tries to stay dormant in default development, and provides safety mechanisms to prevent accidental overwrites of production content.
       5  We cache content for other locales in a [git repository](https://github.com/PauseAI/paraglide) that you clone locally. That's enough to 
     access existing l10n content for other locales during local development - set the ones you want in your environment. New/changed l10n content 
     is generated using LLMs, and you can further opt in to test that locally and even add new locales in `project.inlang/settings.json`, but for 
     day-to-day content changes it is easier to wait for any updated l10n to be automatically generated by our pre-production build, and previewed.

       7  ### Key Concepts
       7  ## Working with Locales
       8  
       9  - **Locales**: Specific language/region combinations (e.g., `en`, `de`, `nl`)
      10  - **L10n Cage**: Git repository storing all generated l10n content (Cache As Git Environment)
      11  - **Modes**: Different operating modes based on environment and configuration
      12  - **Branch Safety**: Prevents local development from writing to production cache
       9  To make other development choices, including building locally rather than running under dev, you'll have to set up your development 
     environment.
         onment.
      10  
      11  ## L10n Modes
      11  Start by copying the environment template.
      12  
      13  The system automatically determines its operating mode:
      14  
      15  ### 1. **en-only** Mode
      16  
      17  - **When**: Only English locale configured (`PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en` or undefined on a dev machine)
      18  - **Behavior**: No l10ns bothered, maximum speed
      19  - **Use case**: Default for local development
      20  
      21  ### 2. **dry-run** Mode
      22  
      23  - **When**: Multiple locales are configured, but either the LLM API key isn't given or is suppressed using the `--dry-run` flag
      24  - **Behavior**: Uses l10ns already captured in the cage, no LLM calls
      25  - **Use case**: Work with existing l10ns without generating new content
      26  
      27  ### 3. **perform** Mode
      28  
      29  - **When**: Multiple locales + valid API key + proper branch
      30  - **Behavior**: Prompts LLMs to capture new l10ns into the cage, locks it by committing, ships it by pushing
      31  - **Use case**: Generating new/updated l10n content
      32  
      33  ## CLI Usage
      34  
      35  ### Automatic L10n Integration
      36  
      37  Running servers or builds automatically invokes l10n operations:
      38  
      13  ```bash
      14  # Development server - runs l10n in dry-run mode only
      15  pnpm dev
      16  
      17  # Production build - runs l10n in whatever mode is configured
      18  pnpm build
      14  cp template.env .env
      15  ```
      16  
      17  ### Manual L10n Commands

      19  ```bash
      20  # Default mode (usually en-only for local dev)
      21  pnpm l10n
      19  Briefly, some dynamic pages need API keys for service calls, and website l10n requires more opting in.
      20  
      21  # Dry-run mode (use cached content only)
      22  pnpm l10n --dry-run
      23  
      24  # Verbose output for debugging
      25  pnpm l10n --verbose
      26  
      27  # Force retranslation of specific files
      28  pnpm l10n --force "*.md"
      29  pnpm l10n --force "2024-*.md"
      30  pnpm l10n --force "faq.md" "proposal.md"
      31  ```
      32  
      33  ### Force Mode Patterns
      34  
      35  Force mode supports glob patterns for selective retranslation:
      36  
      37  - `*.md` - All markdown files
      38  - `2024-*.md` - Files starting with "2024-"
      39  - `**/important.md` - Files named "important.md" anywhere
      40  - `{faq,proposal}.md` - Specific files using brace expansion
      41  
      42  ## Environment Configuration
      43  
      44  ### Locale Selection
      45  
      46  ```bash
      47  # English only (default for local development)
      48  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en
      49  
      50  # Specific locales
      51  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,nl,de
      52  
      53  # All available locales (default in CI)
      54  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=all
      55  
      56  # Exclude specific locales
      57  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=-fr,es  # All except French and Spanish
      58  ```
      59  
      60  ### L10n Capture
      61  
      62  ```bash
      63  # Enable LLM to be prompted to find new l10ns (required for perform mode)
      64  L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
      65  
      66  # Override which l10n cage branch to use (optional)
      67  L10N_BRANCH="my-feature-branch"
      68  ```
      69  
      70  The `L10N_BRANCH` override might be useful when you want to:
      71  
      72  - Use a different cage branch than your current website branch
      73  - Test l10n content from another branch
      74  - Work around branch naming conflicts
      75  
      76  ## Branch Safety System
      77  
      78  The system prevents accidental writes to the production cache:
      79  
      80  ### Local Development Rules
      81  
      82  - **Cannot write to main branch** of the l10n cage from local development
      83  - **Must work on feature branches** in the website repository if new l10ns are to be captured
      84  
      85  ### CI/CD Exception
      86  
      87  - **CI environments can write to main** for production deployments
      88  - **Branch detection** uses environment variables and Git state to separate distinct work
      89  
      90  ### Override Options
      91  
      92  If you need to work around branch safety:
      93  
      94  1. **Use a feature branch** in the website repository (recommended):
      95  
      96     ```bash
      97     git checkout -b my-l10n-work
      98     pnpm l10n  # This creates/uses matching l10n cage branch
      99     ```
     100  
     101  2. **Set explicit branch** in environment:
     102     ```bash
     103     L10N_BRANCH="my-branch" pnpm l10n
     104     ```
     105  
     106  ## L10n Cage Architecture
     107  
     108  ### How the Cage Works
     109  
     110  The l10n cage is a Cache Adopting Git's Engine: a [repository](https://github.com/PauseAI/paraglide) that gets cloned locally as `l10n-ca
         ge/`.
     111  
     112  The cage:
     113  
     114  - **Holds captured l10n content** - in dry-run mode, you access cached l10ns previously captured
     115  - **Captures new l10n content** - in perform mode, LLMs are prompted to find new l10ns that are captured in the cage
     116  - **Locks newly captured l10ns by committing** - to cache the work and prevent reperforming it
     117  - **Ships the captured l10ns to safety by pushing** - makes it safe to e.g. clean out the cage
     118  
     119  This provides:
     120  
     121  - **Version control** of all l10n decisions and changes
     122  - **Branch isolation** between different feature development
     123  - **Audit trail** of what was generated when and why
     124  - **Cost efficiency** by avoiding duplicate LLM calls
     125  
     126  ### Cage Structure
     127  
     128  ```
     129  l10n-cage/
     130  ├── json/           # Aggregated short messages
     131  │   ├── de.json
     132  │   ├── nl.json
     133  │   └── ...
     134  └── md/             # Localized markdown pages

     139      ├── nl/
     140      └── ...
     141  ```
     142  
     143  ### Branch Strategy
     144  
     145  - **main branch**: Production l10n content in the cage
     146  - **Feature branches**: L10n operations create matching cage branches (website `my-feature` → cage `my-feature`)
     147  - **Branch naming**: See [`l10nCageBranch()` function](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts) for complete logic
     148  - **Promotion**: You can use standard git merge commands to promote l10n commits between cage branches
     149  
     150  ## Development Workflow
     151  
     152  ### Day-to-Day Content Changes
     153  
     154  **Most developers never need to run l10n locally** - the CI/CD system handles it automatically:
     155  
     156  1. **Edit content** in English using Decap CMS or direct file editing
     157  2. **Create pull request** from your website branch or fork - this triggers l10n work on a matching cage branch
     158  3. **CMS users**: The CMS creates pull requests automatically, which also trigger l10n generation
     159  4. **L10n is generated automatically** in CI/CD on the appropriate cage branch
     160  5. **Preview l10n results** in staging before merging
     161  
     162  **Current limitation**: While main branch is locked to en-only locale, target your pull requests to `l10-preview` or similar branches tha
         t have all locales enabled in order to have l10ns automatically captured.
     163  
     164  ### L10n Development
     165  
     166  When working on l10n system improvements:
     167  
     168  1. **Set up environment**:
     169  
     170     ```bash
     171     cp template.env .env
     172     # Add your L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
     173     ```
     174  
     175  2. **Work on a feature branch** in the website repository:
     176  
     177     ```bash
     178     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n
     179     ```
     180  
     181  3. **Test changes**:
     182  
     183     ```bash
     184     # Preview/estimate the pending l10n-capturing work
     185     pnpm l10n --dry-run --verbose
     186  
     187     # Perform the captures
     188     PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,de pnpm l10n
     189     ```
     190  
     191  4. **Force recapturing particular l10ns**:
     192     ```bash
     193     pnpm l10n --force "specific-file.md"
     194     ```
     195  
     196  ### Reusing L10n Content Between Branches
     197  
     198  If you want to use l10n content you already captured in another cage branch without regenerating it (to avoid cost or non-determinism), y
         ou can promote commits between l10n cage branches:
     199  
     200  ```bash
     201  # Switch to the l10n cage directory
     202  cd l10n-cage
     203  
     204  # Merge commits from another branch
     205  git checkout my-current-branch
     206  git merge other-feature-branch
     207  
     208  # Return to website directory
     209  cd ..
     210  ```
     211  
     212  This lets you reuse expensive LLM-generated content across different feature branches.
     213  
     214  ### Adding New Locales
     215  
     216  1. **Add locale to configuration**:
     217  
     218     ```javascript
     219     // project.inlang/default-settings.js
     220     locales: ['en', 'nl', 'de', 'fr'] // Add 'fr'
     221     ```
     222  
     223  2. **Estimate work locally**:
     224  
     225     ```bash
     226     PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,fr pnpm l10n --dry-run --verbose
     227     ```
     228  
     229  3. You could **perform it locally** or **through a pull request**
     230  
     231  ## Troubleshooting
     232  
     233  ### Common Issues
     234  
     235  **"Cannot write to main branch"**
     236  
     237  - Solution: Work on a feature branch, hide your API key, or use `--dry-run`
     238  
     239  **"API key too short"**
     240  
     241  - Solution: Set a valid `L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (10+ characters)
     242  
     243  **"Git push authentication failed"**
     244  
     245  - Solution: Set up GitHub Personal Access Token or use `--dry-run`
     246  
     247  **Missing l10n files**
     248  
     249  - Solution: Run `pnpm l10n --dry-run` to ensure cache is set up
     250  
     251  ### Debug Mode
     252  
     253  For detailed debugging:
     254  
     255  ```bash
     256  pnpm l10n --dry-run --verbose
     257  ```
     258  
     259  This shows:
     260  
     261  - Mode determination reasoning
     262  - Cache setup details
     263  - File processing information
     264  - Branch and environment status, and estimated costs
     265  
     266  ## Production Considerations
     267  
     268  ### CI/CD Integration
     269  
     270  The l10n system is designed to run automatically in CI/CD:
     271  
     272  - **Defaults to all locales** in CI environments without overrides
     273  - **Uses production API keys** from environment
     274  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** [based on deployment context](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts#:~:text=function%20l10nCageBranc
         h)
     275  - **Integrates with build process** via `pnpm build`
     276  
     277  ### Performance
     278  
     279  - **Cache-first approach**: Avoids duplicate LLM calls
     280  - **Selective regeneration**: Only processes changed content
     281  - **Branch isolation**: Prevents conflicts between parallel development
     282  
     283  ### Cost Management
     284  
     285  - **Git-based caching** eliminates duplicate API calls
     286  - **Force mode** allows targeted regeneration when needed
     287  - **Dry-run mode** enables testing without API costs

     ## How L10n Works
     We cache l10n content in a [git repository](https://github.com/PauseAI/paraglide) that gets cloned locally. This provides access to existing
     l10n content for all configured locales during local development - you can set which ones you want in your environment.
     New or changed l10n content is generated using LLMs. You can opt in to test this locally and even add new locales in

     [TODO: Add comprehensive l10n documentation including mode system, branch safety, force mode, etc.]

● Now let me also clean up a small issue in the README - the "website translations" phrase should be "website l10n":

     22  TRANSLATION_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
     23  # Uncomment the line above and add your API key to enable translation generation

     26  # L10N_BRANCH="my-feature-branch"
     27  

● Now let me also update the comment about default locales to reflect the new CI-based behavior:

● Update(template.env)
  ⎿  (No changes)

> You can leave the "translation" clue.

● You're right, I'll leave that as is. Let me just update the section header:

● Update(template.env)

     10  # Localization (i.e. translation) settings
     10  # Localization (L10n) settings
     11  # The set of all locales is defined in project.inlang/default-settings.js,
     12  #  but we allow an environment variable override because using fewer locales
     13  #  can significantly improve local development convenience and build speed!
  ⎿  ☒ Review recent commits and v2 plan for implementation details
     ☒ Update README.md with basic setup and pnpm targets
     ☒ Update template.env with new L10N_ variables
     ☒ Fix locale default logic to use CI detection instead of isDev()
     ☐ Create comprehensive L10N.md documentation
     ☐ Review and amend commits based on documentation needs
     ☐ Stage env.ts changes for commit 7a4cdbc when amending

● Now let me work on the comprehensive L10N.md documentation. Based on the v2 plan and commits, I need to document:

  1. The three l10n modes (en-only, dry-run, perform)
  2. Branch safety system
  3. Force mode with glob patterns
  4. CLI usage and flags
  5. Development workflow
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Other way around. The header should have been left, the CI note included.

● You're absolutely right! Let me fix that:

● Update(template.env)
  ⎿  Updated template.env with 2 additions and 2 removals
      7  # Used for the /write feature - optional for most local development
      8  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FOR_WRITE = ""
      9 
     10  # Localization (L10n) settings
     10  # Localization (i.e. translation) settings
     11  # The set of all locales is defined in project.inlang/default-settings.js,
     12  #  but we allow an environment variable override because using fewer locales
     13  #  can significantly improve local development convenience and build speed!
     14  # We even default this to only "en" if not specified in a developer environment. 
     14  # Default: "en" for local development, "all" in CI/CD environments 
     15  # This is a comma-separated list. "-" switches into exclude mode. Examples: "en", "en,nl", "all", "-de,fr"
     16  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en
     17 

● Perfect! Now the template.env properly documents the new CI-based default behavior while keeping the helpful translation clue.

  Now shall I continue with the comprehensive L10N.md documentation?

       7  New or changed l10n content is generated using LLMs. You can opt in to test this locally and even add new locales in 
     `project.inlang/settings.json`, but for day-to-day content changes it's easier to wait for updated l10n to be automatically generated by our
     pre-production build and preview the results there.

       7  The l10n system automatically generates locale-appropriate content using LLMs. It operates in different modes based on your environment 
     and provides safety mechanisms to prevent accidental overwrites of production content.

      10  ### Key Concepts
      11  
      12  - **Locales**: Specific language/region combinations (e.g., `en`, `de`, `nl`)
      13  - **L10n Cache**: Git repository storing all generated l10n content
      14  - **Modes**: Different operating modes based on environment and configuration
      15  - **Branch Safety**: Prevents local development from writing to production cache
      16  
      17  ## L10n Modes
      18  
      19  The system automatically determines its operating mode:
      20  
      21  ### 1. **en-only** Mode
      22  - **When**: Only English locale configured (`PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en`)
      23  - **Behavior**: No l10n processing, maximum speed
      24  - **Use case**: Default for local development
      25  
      26  ### 2. **dry-run** Mode  
      27  - **When**: Multiple locales configured but no API key or `--dry-run` flag
      28  - **Behavior**: Uses existing cached l10n content, no LLM calls
      29  - **Use case**: Preview existing l10n without generating new content
      30  
      31  ### 3. **perform** Mode
      32  - **When**: Multiple locales + valid API key + proper branch
      33  - **Behavior**: Full l10n generation with LLM calls and cache updates
      34  - **Use case**: Generating new/updated l10n content
      35  
      36  ## CLI Usage
      37  
      38  ### Basic Commands
      39  
      40  ```bash
      41  # Default mode (usually en-only for local dev)
      42  pnpm l10n
      43  
      44  # Dry-run mode (use cached content only)
      45  pnpm l10n --dry-run
      46  
      47  # Verbose output for debugging
      48  pnpm l10n --verbose
      49  
      50  # Force retranslation of specific files
      51  pnpm l10n --force "*.md"
      52  pnpm l10n --force "2024-*.md"
      53  pnpm l10n --force "faq.md" "proposal.md"
      54  ```
      55  
      56  ### Force Mode Patterns
      57  
      58  Force mode supports glob patterns for selective retranslation:
      59  
      60  - `*.md` - All markdown files
      61  - `2024-*.md` - Files starting with "2024-"
      62  - `**/important.md` - Files named "important.md" anywhere
      63  - `{faq,proposal}.md` - Specific files using brace expansion
      64  
      65  ## Environment Configuration
      66  
      67  ### Locale Selection
      68  
      69  ```bash
      70  # English only (default for local development)
      71  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en
      72  
      73  # Specific locales
      74  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,nl,de
      75  
      76  # All available locales (default in CI)
      77  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=all
      78  
      79  # Exclude specific locales
      80  PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=-fr,es  # All except French and Spanish
      81  ```
      82  
      83  ### L10n Generation
      84  
      85  ```bash
      86  # Enable l10n generation (required for perform mode)
      87  L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
      88  
      89  # Override cache branch (optional)
      90  L10N_BRANCH="my-feature-branch"
      91  ```
      92  
      93  ## Branch Safety System
      94  
      95  The system prevents accidental writes to the production cache:
      96  
      97  ### Local Development Rules
      98  - **Cannot write to main branch** from local development
      99  - **Must work on feature branches** for l10n generation
     100  - **Automatic branch creation** if needed
     101  
     102  ### CI/CD Exception
     103  - **CI environments can write to main** for production deployments
     104  - **Branch detection** uses environment variables and Git state
     105  
     106  ### Override Options
     107  If you need to work around branch safety:
     108  
     109  1. **Use a feature branch** (recommended):
     110     ```bash
     111     git checkout -b my-l10n-work
     112     pnpm l10n
     113     ```
     114  
     115  2. **Set explicit branch** in environment:
     116     ```bash
     117     L10N_BRANCH="my-branch" pnpm l10n
     118     ```
     119  
     120  3. **Use dry-run mode** to preview without writing:
     121     ```bash
     122     pnpm l10n --dry-run
     123     ```
     124  
     125  ## L10n Cache Architecture
     126  
     127  ### How It Works
     128  
     129  We cache l10n content in a [git repository](https://github.com/PauseAI/paraglide) that gets cloned locally as `l10n-cage/`. This provides
         :
     130  
     131  - **Access to existing l10n content** for all configured locales
     132  - **Version control** of all l10n decisions and changes  
     133  - **Branch isolation** between different feature development
     134  - **Audit trail** of what was generated when and why
     135  
     136  ### Cache Structure
     137  
     138  ```
     139  l10n-cage/
     140  ├── json/           # Aggregated short messages
     141  │   ├── de.json
     142  │   ├── nl.json
     143  │   └── ...
     144  └── md/             # Localized markdown pages

     149      ├── nl/
     150      └── ...
     151  ```
     152  
     153  ### Branch Strategy
     154  
     155  - **main branch**: Production l10n content
     156  - **Feature branches**: Isolated l10n development
     157  - **Automatic sync**: Between website branches and cache branches
     158  
     159  ## Development Workflow
     160  
     161  ### Day-to-Day Content Changes
     162  
     163  For most content editing, you don't need to run l10n locally:
     164  
     165  1. **Edit content** in English using Decap CMS or direct file editing
     166  2. **Create pull request** as normal
     167  3. **L10n is generated automatically** in CI/CD
     168  4. **Preview l10n results** in staging before merging
     169  
     170  ### L10n Development
     171  
     172  When working on l10n system improvements:
     173  
     174  1. **Set up environment**:
     175     ```bash
     176     cp template.env .env
     177     # Add your L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
     178     ```
     179  
     180  2. **Work on a feature branch**:
     181     ```bash
     182     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n
     183     ```
     184  
     185  3. **Test changes**:
     186     ```bash
     187     # Preview with existing cache
     188     pnpm l10n --dry-run --verbose
     189     
     190     # Generate new content
     191     PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,de pnpm l10n
     192     ```
     193  
     194  4. **Force retranslation if needed**:
     195     ```bash
     196     pnpm l10n --force "specific-file.md"
     197     ```
     198  
     199  ### Adding New Locales
     200  
     201  1. **Add locale to configuration**:
     202     ```javascript
     203     // project.inlang/default-settings.js
     204     locales: ['en', 'nl', 'de', 'fr']  // Add 'fr'
     205     ```
     206  
     207  2. **Test locally**:
     208     ```bash
     209     PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,fr pnpm l10n --dry-run
     210     ```
     211  
     212  3. **Generate initial content**:
     213     ```bash
     214     PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en,fr pnpm l10n
     215     ```
     216  
     217  ## Troubleshooting
     218  
     219  ### Common Issues
     220  
     221  **"Cannot write to main branch"**
     222  - Solution: Work on a feature branch or use `--dry-run`
     223  
     224  **"API key too short"**  
     225  - Solution: Set a valid `L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (10+ characters)
     226  
     227  **"Git push authentication failed"**
     228  - Solution: Set up GitHub Personal Access Token or use `--dry-run`
     229  
     230  **Missing l10n files**
     231  - Solution: Run `pnpm l10n --dry-run` to ensure cache is set up
     232  
     233  ### Debug Mode
     234  
     235  For detailed debugging:
     236  
     237  ```bash
     238  pnpm l10n --dry-run --verbose
     239  ```
     240  
     241  This shows:
     242  - Mode determination reasoning
     243  - Cache setup details  
     244  - File processing information
     245  - Branch and environment status
     246  
     247  ## Production Considerations
     248  
     249  ### CI/CD Integration
     250  
     251  The l10n system is designed to run automatically in CI/CD:
     252  
     253  - **Defaults to all locales** in CI environments
     254  - **Uses production API keys** from environment
     255  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** based on deployment context
     256  - **Integrates with build process** via `pnpm build`
     257  
     258  ### Performance
     259  
     260  - **Cache-first approach**: Avoids duplicate LLM calls
     261  - **Selective regeneration**: Only processes changed content
     262  - **Branch isolation**: Prevents conflicts between parallel development
     263  
     264  ### Cost Management
     265  
     266  - **Git-based caching** eliminates duplicate API calls
     267  - **Force mode** allows targeted regeneration when needed
     268  - **Dry-run mode** enables testing without API costs

     ☒ Fix locale default logic to use CI detection instead of isDev()
     ☐ Review and amend commits based on documentation needs
     ☐ Stage env.ts changes for commit 7a4cdbc when amending

● Perfect! I've created comprehensive L10N.md documentation that covers:

  - Complete CLI usage including force mode with glob patterns
  - Branch safety system and how to work around it
  - Environment configuration for locales and API keys
  - Cache architecture and branch strategy
  - Development workflows for both content editors and l10n developers
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Production considerations for CI/CD integration

  Now let's review what needs to be amended in the commits. We have:

  1. Documentation changes (README.md, template.env, L10N.md) - these can go in a new documentation commit
  2. env.ts behavior change - this should go in commit 7a4cdbc since it changes live behavior

  Should I proceed with amending the commits, or would you like to review the documentation first?

> Reviewing the L10N.md
  - we're trying to call the Git Cache as represented on the developer or CI/CD machine the l10n "cage".

  It likely bacronyms somehow ("Cache As Git E-thing", "Cache A-ing Git Externally" or similar.) In a dry-run the cage holds l10ns that we 
  previously captured, when performing true localization then we prompt our LLM assistant to capture new l10ns for into the cage, lock it by 
  commiting and ship them off for use elsewhere (e.g. to build in the CI/CD) through pushing. 

  - when you talk of using a feature branch, logging and code take care to say that if you have a pauseai-website feature branch, we create and use 
  a l10n-cage branch of the same name. As is I think developers reading might be unclear about whether they make the feature branch in the cage 
  explicitly - they should never have to do that.

  - it's not the usual pattern, but if you *want* to use l10ns you already captured and shipped in some cage in another branch without recapturing 
  them (because of cost or non-determinism) you can promote commits between l10n cage branches using standard git merge commands.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is giving me feedback on the L10N.md documentation:

  1. They want me to use "cage" terminology more consistently and explain the "l10n cage" concept better. They're saying it's a backronym like 
  "Cache As Git Environment" or similar. The metaphor is that it's a cage that holds the l10ns - in dry-run mode it holds previously captured l10ns,
   in perform mode we capture new l10ns into the cage, lock it by committing, and ship them off by pushing.
  2. They want me to clarify the branch mapping - when you have a pauseai-website feature branch, the system automatically creates and uses an 
  l10n-cage branch of the same name. Developers don't need to manually create branches in the cage.
  3. They want me to mention that you can use git merge commands to promote commits between l10n cage branches if you want to reuse l10ns from 
  another branch without regenerating them.

  Let me update the L10N.md to address these points.

● Excellent feedback! Let me update L10N.md to clarify the cage concept and branch mapping:

     128  The l10n cage is a [git repository](https://github.com/PauseAI/paraglide) that gets cloned locally as `l10n-cage/`. Think of it as a cage 
     that:
          that:
     129 
     130  - **Access to existing l10n content** for all configured locales
     130  - **Holds captured l10n content** - in dry-run mode, you access l10ns previously captured
     131  - **Captures new l10n content** - in perform mode, LLMs generate new l10ns into the cage  
     132  - **Locks content by committing** - ensures l10n decisions are preserved
     133  - **Ships content by pushing** - makes l10ns available for CI/CD builds
     134  
     135  This provides:
     136  - **Version control** of all l10n decisions and changes

     159 
     160  - **main branch**: Production l10n content
     161  - **Feature branches**: Isolated l10n development
     162  - **Automatic sync**: Between website branches and cache branches
     160  - **main branch**: Production l10n content in the cage
     161  - **Feature branches**: Automatically created in the cage to match website feature branches
     162  - **Branch mapping**: Website branch `my-feature` → l10n cage branch `my-feature`
     163  - **Promotion**: You can use standard git merge commands to promote l10n commits between cage branches
     164 
     165  ## Development Workflow
     166 

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to add a section about promoting commits between cage branches, as the user mentioned this is a useful but non-standard pattern.

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 18 additions
     202     pnpm l10n --force "specific-file.md"
     203     ```
     204 
     205  ### Reusing L10n Content Between Branches
     206  
     207  If you want to use l10n content you already captured in another cage branch without regenerating it (to avoid cost or non-determinism), y
         ou can promote commits between l10n cage branches:
     208  
     209  ```bash
     210  # Switch to the l10n cage directory
     211  cd l10n-cage
     212  
     213  # Merge commits from another branch
     214  git checkout my-current-branch
     215  git merge other-feature-branch
     216  
     217  # Return to website directory
     218  cd ..
     219  ```
     220  
     221  This lets you reuse expensive LLM-generated content across different feature branches.
     222  
     223  ### Adding New Locales
     224 
     225  1. **Add locale to configuration**:

✻ Thinking…

  Let me also update the workflow section to clarify that developers work on website branches, not cage branches directly.

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 2 additions and 2 removals
     183     # Add your L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
     184     ```
     185 
     186  2. **Work on a feature branch**:
     186  2. **Work on a feature branch** in the website repository:
     187     ```bash
     188     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n
     188     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n  # Matching cage branch created automatically
     189     ```
     190 
     191  3. **Test changes**:

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I've updated the L10N.md documentation to:

  1. Use "cage" terminology consistently and explain the Cache As Git Environment concept
  2. Clarify that feature branches are created in the website repository and automatically mapped to cage branches
  3. Add a section about promoting commits between cage branches for reusing l10n content
  4. Use the cage metaphor throughout (holds, captures, locks, ships)

  The documentation now clearly explains that developers work on website feature branches and the system automatically handles the cage branch 
  mapping, which should eliminate confusion about where to create branches.

● Perfect! I've updated the L10N.md documentation to address all your feedback:

  Key Changes Made:

  1. Cage terminology and metaphor:
    - Explained "Cache As Git Environment" backronym
    - Used cage metaphor throughout: "holds captured l10n content", "captures new l10n content", "locks by committing", "ships by pushing"
  2. Branch mapping clarification:
    - Made it clear that developers work on website repository feature branches
    - Emphasized that l10n cage branches are automatically created with matching names
    - Added comments like # Matching cage branch created automatically
  3. Added section on promoting commits:
    - Documented how to use standard git merge commands to promote l10n content between cage branches
    - Explained the use case: avoiding cost and non-determinism by reusing expensive LLM-generated content

  The documentation now clearly shows that developers never need to manually work with cage branches - they just work on website feature branches
  and the system handles the cage branch mapping automatically.

> "# This automatically creates matching l10n cage branch"
  This reads as the "git checkout" command, which does not itself act. It's the dry-run and performance of l10n that set up / write to the matching 
  branch.

● You're absolutely right! The git checkout command itself doesn't create the cage branch. Let me fix those comments:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 2 additions and 2 removals
     107 
     108  1. **Use a feature branch** in the website repository (recommended):
     109     ```bash
     110     git checkout -b my-l10n-work  # This automatically creates matching l10n cage branch
     111     pnpm l10n
     110     git checkout -b my-l10n-work
     111     pnpm l10n  # This creates/uses matching l10n cage branch
     112     ```
     113 
     114  2. **Set explicit branch** in environment:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
     185 
     186  2. **Work on a feature branch** in the website repository:

     188     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n  # Matching cage branch created automatically
     188     git checkout -b improve-german-l10n
     189     ```
     190 
     191  3. **Test changes**:

● And let me also clarify in the branch strategy section:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
     158  ### Branch Strategy
     159 
     160  - **main branch**: Production l10n content in the cage
     161  - **Feature branches**: Automatically created in the cage to match website feature branches
     161  - **Feature branches**: Created in the cage by l10n operations to match website feature branches
     162  - **Branch mapping**: Website branch `my-feature` → l10n cage branch `my-feature`
     163  - **Promotion**: You can use standard git merge commands to promote l10n commits between cage branches
     164 

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
      96  ### Local Development Rules
      97  - **Cannot write to main branch** of the l10n cage from local development
      98  - **Must work on feature branches** in the website repository for l10n generation
      99  - **Automatic l10n cage branch creation** with same name as website branch
      99  - **L10n cage branch creation** by l10n operations with same name as website branch
     100 
     101  ### CI/CD Exception
     102  - **CI environments can write to main** for production deployments

● Perfect! Now the documentation correctly shows that it's the l10n operations (pnpm l10n) that create and manage the cage branches, not the git
  checkout commands themselves. The git commands just set up the website repository branch that the l10n system then uses to determine which cage
  branch to work with.

> Under strategy, aren't the feature branches and branch mapping lines talking about the same mechanism?

  One we're localizing properly on main, regular developers who aren't performing l10n on their machine should know they can rely on the CI/CD to do
   it for them. Creating a pull request from their website branch or fork performs the work on a suitably named cage branch, and therefore so does 
  adding/changing content through the CMS (it too creates pull requests.) This merits mention: you can link to code rather than documenting each

  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Under strategy, aren't the feature branches and branch mapping lines talking about the same mechanism? Same qualm in the local development 
  section.

  I don't think we've discussed the L10N_BRANCH override in L10N.md although I guess it is described in template.env.

  One we're localizing properly on main, regular developers who aren't performing l10n on their machine should know they can rely on the CI/CD to do
   it for them. Creating a pull request from their website branch or fork performs the work on a suitably named cage branch, and therefore so does 
  adding/changing content through the CMS (it too creates pull requests.) This merits mention: you can link to code rather than documenting each 
  naming convention.

  (While main is still locked to only the en locale then to get l10n work done by the CI/CD you'd need to make a pull request to a special branch 
  like l10-preview that gets branch previews and has all locales configured. This situation should be transient but we should note it while it 
  exists.)

✻ Thinking…

  The user is making several good points:

  1. The feature branches and branch mapping lines are redundant - they're talking about the same mechanism.
  2. The local development section also has redundant information about branch creation.
  3. L10N_BRANCH override isn't properly explained in L10N.md (though it's in template.env).
  4. Regular developers should know they can rely on CI/CD to do l10n for them - they don't need to run l10n locally. This includes:
    - Creating pull requests from website branches/forks
    - Using CMS (which creates pull requests)
    - Both trigger l10n work on suitably named cage branches
  5. I should link to code for branch naming rather than documenting conventions.
  6. Current transient situation: main is locked to en-only, so to get l10n work done by CI/CD you need to target special branches like l10-preview 
  that have all locales configured.

  Let me fix these issues:

  1. Combine the redundant branch strategy lines
  2. Fix the local development section
  3. Add proper L10N_BRANCH documentation
  4. Add section about relying on CI/CD for regular developers
  5. Note the current transient main-branch situation

● You're absolutely right on all points! Let me fix those redundancies and add the missing context:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 removal

      99  - **L10n cage branch creation** by l10n operations with same name as website branch
      99 
     100  ### CI/CD Exception
     101  - **CI environments can write to main** for production deployments

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I removed the redundant line about cage branch creation. Now let me fix the branch strategy section to combine the redundant lines.

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 2 additions and 2 removals
     157  ### Branch Strategy
     158 
     159  - **main branch**: Production l10n content in the cage
     160  - **Feature branches**: Created in the cage by l10n operations to match website feature branches
     161  - **Branch mapping**: Website branch `my-feature` → l10n cage branch `my-feature`
     160  - **Feature branches**: L10n operations create matching cage branches (website `my-feature` → cage `my-feature`)
     161  - **Branch naming**: See [`l10nCageBranch()` function](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts) for complete logic
     162  - **Promotion**: You can use standard git merge commands to promote l10n commits between cage branches
     163 
     164  ## Development Workflow

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I combined the redundant lines and added a link to the actual code. Now let me add the L10N_BRANCH documentation and update the development 
  workflow section to emphasize that regular developers can rely on CI/CD.

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 7 additions and 1 removal
      85  # Enable l10n generation (required for perform mode)
      86  L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
      87 
      88  # Override cache branch (optional)
      88  # Override which l10n cage branch to use (optional)
      89  # Default: matches current website branch name, or special handling for CI
      90  L10N_BRANCH="my-feature-branch"
      91  ```
      92 
      93  The `L10N_BRANCH` override is useful when you want to:
      94  - Use a different cage branch than your current website branch
      95  - Test l10n content from another branch  
      96  - Work around branch naming conflicts
      97  
      98  ## Branch Safety System
      99 
     100  The system prevents accidental writes to the production cache:

  Now let me update the development workflow section to emphasize that regular developers can rely on CI/CD and mention the current transient 
  situation with main being locked to en-only.

     171 
     172  ### Day-to-Day Content Changes
     173 
     174  For most content editing, you don't need to run l10n locally:
     174  **Most developers never need to run l10n locally** - the CI/CD system handles it automatically:
     175 
     176  1. **Edit content** in English using Decap CMS or direct file editing
     177  2. **Create pull request** as normal
     178  3. **L10n is generated automatically** in CI/CD
     179  4. **Preview l10n results** in staging before merging
     177  2. **Create pull request** from your website branch or fork - this triggers l10n work on a matching cage branch
     178  3. **CMS users**: The CMS creates pull requests automatically, which also trigger l10n generation
     179  4. **L10n is generated automatically** in CI/CD on the appropriate cage branch
     180  5. **Preview l10n results** in staging before merging
     181 
     182  **Current limitation**: While main branch is locked to en-only locale, target your pull requests to `l10-preview` or similar branches tha
         t have full l10n enabled to see automatic l10n generation in action.
     183  
     184  ### L10n Development
     185 
     186  When working on l10n system improvements:

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've addressed all the user's points:

  1. ✅ Removed redundant branch mapping/feature branch lines
  2. ✅ Fixed local development section redundancy
  3. ✅ Added proper L10N_BRANCH documentation with explanation
  4. ✅ Emphasized that regular developers can rely on CI/CD
  5. ✅ Mentioned that CMS and pull requests both trigger l10n work
  6. ✅ Added link to code for branch naming logic
  7. ✅ Noted the current transient situation with main being en-only

  The documentation now clearly separates:
  - Regular developers who just edit content and rely on CI/CD
  - L10n system developers who need to run l10n locally

  And it properly explains the current deployment strategy during the transition period.

● Perfect! I've addressed all your feedback:

  Key Fixes Made:

  1. Removed redundancy: Combined the feature branches/branch mapping lines that were talking about the same mechanism
  2. Added L10N_BRANCH documentation: Explained what it does and when to use it
  3. Emphasized CI/CD workflow: Made it clear that most developers never need to run l10n locally - they can rely on the automatic system
  4. Documented automatic triggers:
    - Pull requests from website branches/forks trigger matching cage branch work
    - CMS creates pull requests which also trigger l10n generation
  5. Linked to code: Referenced the actual l10nCageBranch() function instead of documenting naming conventions
  6. Noted current limitation: While main is en-only, developers should target l10-preview or similar branches to see full l10n in action

  The documentation now clearly separates the workflows:
  - Regular content editors: Rely on CI/CD, never run l10n locally
  - L10n system developers: Need local l10n setup for system improvements

  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 13 additions and 1 removal
     34 
     35  ## CLI Usage
     36 
     37  ### Basic Commands
     37  ### Automatic L10n Integration
     38 
     39  The build system automatically invokes l10n operations:
     40  
     41  ```bash
     42  # Development server - runs l10n in dry-run mode only
     43  pnpm dev
     44  
     45  # Production build - runs l10n in whatever mode is configured
     46  pnpm build
     47  ```
     48  
     49  ### Manual L10n Commands
     50  
     51  ```bash
     52  # Default mode (usually en-only for local dev)
     53  pnpm l10n
     54 

● Perfect! Now the CLI usage section clearly explains the difference between:

  - pnpm dev: Automatically runs l10n but limited to dry-run mode only (safe for development)
  - pnpm build: Automatically runs l10n in whatever mode is configured (can perform full l10n generation in appropriate environments)

  This helps developers understand that the development server is safe and won't accidentally generate expensive LLM calls, while the build process
  respects the full mode configuration for production scenarios.

  The documentation now covers all the key points and is ready for commit amendments. Shall we proceed with staging the changes and amending the
  appropriate commits?

> I've tweaked a few things so do re-read.

  Lastly under CI/CD Integration please link "based on deployment context" to the code for l10nCageBranch in branch-safety.ts?

● Read(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I can see you've made great improvements to the language throughout! The terminology is much more natural ("prompts LLMs to capture new l10ns",
  "Cache Adopting Git's Engine", "estimate/perform locally", etc.).

  Let me add the link to the branch detection code:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
     288 
     289  - **Defaults to all locales** in CI environments without overrides
     290  - **Uses production API keys** from environment
     291  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** based on deployment context
     291  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** [based on deployment context](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts#L31-L55)
     292  - **Integrates with build process** via `pnpm build`
     293 
     294  ### Performance

● Perfect! Now the documentation includes a direct link to the l10nCageBranch() function that shows exactly how the branch detection logic works in
  different deployment contexts.

  Your improvements have made the language much more vivid and accurate - using "prompts LLMs", "capture l10ns", "estimate/perform" really helps
  developers understand what's happening under the hood. The "Cache Adopting Git's Engine" expansion of CAGE is clever too!

  The documentation is now comprehensive and ready. Shall we proceed with staging these changes and amending the appropriate commits?

> That link will rot. Is there any way to link to a sought phrase (even if it only works once on the GitHub website?)

● Yes! GitHub supports linking to specific lines and you can also link to function names or search terms. Here are the options:

● Update(L10N.md)
  ⎿  Updated L10N.md with 1 addition and 1 removal
     288 
     289  - **Defaults to all locales** in CI environments without overrides
     290  - **Uses production API keys** from environment
     291  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** [based on deployment context](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts#L31-L55)
     291  - **Writes to appropriate cache branches** [based on deployment 
     context](./scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts#:~:text=function%20l10nCageBranch)
         h)
     292  - **Integrates with build process** via `pnpm build`
     293 
     294  ### Performance

● This uses GitHub's text fragment syntax (#:~:text=) which will search for and highlight the text "function l10nCageBranch" on the page. This is
  more resilient than line numbers since it will find the function even if the line numbers change due to code additions/deletions above it.

  The link should work both on GitHub's website and in many modern browsers that support text fragments.

> Great!

  It's finally time to amend commits with better messages, I guess. I'd like to express concepts in the same terms we use in L10N.md (reference 
  particular document sections if useful.) We should also record key decisions and helpful details of implementation: you might inspect the diff and
   read the completed v2 plan to work out good candidates to record.

  Let's go one unpushed commit at a time. Discuss your plan for each after inspecting.

● Excellent! Let's tackle the commits one by one. Let me start by inspecting the first (oldest) commit:

● Read(../../../L10N_BRANCH_SAFETY_PLAN_v2.md)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Plan for Commit fc15901 (Branch Safety Module)

  Key aspects to highlight:

  1. Prevents accidental l10n cage writes - implements the core safety mechanism from L10N.md "Branch Safety System"
  2. Dynamic branch detection - supports CI environments (Netlify PR previews, branch deploys) and local development
  3. L10N_BRANCH override - allows explicit branch targeting
  4. Git authentication testing - prevents failed commits by testing credentials upfront
  5. Comprehensive test coverage - 114 lines of tests for various scenarios

  Improved commit message:
  feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system

  Prevents accidental writes to production l10n cage from local development while
  supporting CI/CD workflows. Implements dynamic branch detection with fallbacks:
  - L10N_BRANCH environment override
  - CI environment detection (Netlify PR previews, branch deploys)  
  - Current git branch as fallback

  Key safety features:
  - Blocks local development writes to main cage branch
  - Tests git authentication upfront to prevent failed commits
  - Automatic branch creation and upstream tracking
  - Comprehensive test coverage (114 test lines)

  See L10N.md "Branch Safety System" section for usage.

  This references the L10N.md documentation, explains the key decision (preventing accidental production writes), and highlights the implementation
  details (dynamic detection, auth testing, comprehensive tests).

  Should I proceed with this improved message, or would you like me to adjust anything?

● Plan for Commit 6d18e4f (Mode System)

  Key aspects to highlight:

  1. Implements the three l10n modes from L10N.md: en-only, dry-run, perform
  2. Centralized mode determination - replaces scattered logic with clean Mode class
  3. Safe defaults - automatically prevents expensive operations in dev environments
  4. Comprehensive testing - 295 lines of tests covering all scenarios
  5. Clear announcements - mode.announce() tells developers what will happen

  Improved commit message:
  feat: implement l10n mode system with centralized determination

  Creates the Mode class implementing the three l10n operating modes:
  - en-only: No l10ns bothered, maximum speed (default for local dev)
  - dry-run: Uses captured l10ns only, no LLM calls (missing API key or --dry-run flag)
  - perform: Prompts LLMs to capture new l10ns into cage (valid API key + proper branch)

  Key features:
  - Centralized mode determination replacing scattered logic
  - Safe defaults prevent expensive operations in development
  - Clear mode announcements via mode.announce()
  - Branch safety integration for perform mode validation
  - Comprehensive test coverage (295 test lines, 100% coverage)

  See L10N.md "L10n Modes" section for behavior details.

  This uses the language from L10N.md ("no l10ns bothered", "captured l10ns", "prompts LLMs") and references the specific documentation section.

  Shall I proceed with this amendment?

> Wait no. Go back to your "oh, the commit order has changed" assertion. That sounds worrying. It looks like you amended the most recent commit 
  instead of the earliest of the five. Please undo that and amend the correct commit.

● You're absolutely right! I amended the wrong commit. Let me check what happened and fix it:

● Bash(git log --oneline -6)
  ⎿  0627c9a feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system
     be5ae40 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
     b5f965b feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
     6d18e4f feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
     fc15901 feat: add branch safety module
     c55769b refactor: Improve postbuild scripts and localization terminology

● I see the issue! I accidentally amended the most recent commit (0627c9a) instead of the oldest one (fc15901). Let me undo this:

● Bash(git reset --soft HEAD~1)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Uh, does that work? Couldn't you just amend the message back to what it was (original oneline title, no further text.)

● You're right! Much safer to just fix the message. Let me restore the original simple message:

● Bash(git commit --amend -m "feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)")
  ⎿  [l10-preview fe0a16d] feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
      Date: Wed Jun 11 16:27:39 2025 +0100
      15 files changed, 436 insertions(+), 349 deletions(-)
     → No staged files found.

● Good! Now let me check the commit order to work on the correct (oldest) commit:

● Bash(git log --oneline -6)
  ⎿  fe0a16d feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
     be5ae40 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
     b5f965b feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
     6d18e4f feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
     fc15901 feat: add branch safety module
     c55769b refactor: Improve postbuild scripts and localization terminology

● Perfect! Now let me work on the oldest commit (fc15901) using interactive rebase:

● Bash(git rebase -i c55769b)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Can you perform an "interactive" rebase? Won't it hang waiting for you to interact?

● You're absolutely right! Interactive rebase would hang waiting for editor input. Let me use a different approach - I can rebase and reword
  specific commits using git rebase --exec or target specific commits with their SHA.

  Actually, let me use the most direct approach - git commit --fixup and then git rebase --autosquash, or even simpler, I can use git rebase with
  specific commit targeting.

  Let me try the most straightforward method:

● Bash(git rebase --reword-on-the-fly fc15901 -m "feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system…)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Want to try that as a dry-run first for more confidence it is well-formed?

● Good idea! Let me check if that --reword-on-the-fly flag even exists:

● Bash(git rebase --help | grep -i reword)
  ⎿             edited or reworded will have the trailer added.
                or --fixup=reword: and --squash options respectively of git-
        Commit Rewording
            command "pick" with the command "reword".

● That flag doesn't exist. Let me try a more reliable approach using git filter-branch or creating a temporary script. Actually, the safest approach
   might be to create a script that git can execute:

● Bash(echo 'git commit --amend -m "feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system…)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> I'm not clear how you are planning to use that.

  Am I to understand you cannot run simply commit --amend on an older, specified commit?

  If you do need to perform some kind of rebase, can you not ask for it to be non-interactive?

● You're right - I can't git commit --amend on an older commit directly, only on HEAD. And I should try a non-interactive rebase approach.

  Let me try using git rebase with the --exec option to run a command at a specific commit:

● Bash(git rebase --exec 'if [ "$(git log --format=%s -1)" = "feat: add branch safety module" ]; then git commit --amend -m "feat: implement l10n
      cage branch safety sy…)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Explain what the command and parameters you are using mean.

● You're right to ask me to explain! Let me break down what I was trying to do:

  git rebase --exec 'command' c55769b means:
  - git rebase c55769b: Replay all commits since commit c55769b (the parent of our first target commit)
  - --exec 'command': After applying each commit during the rebase, execute the given shell command
  - The shell command: Check if the current commit's subject line matches "feat: add branch safety module", and if so, amend it with the new message

  However, this approach is quite complex and error-prone.

  A simpler approach might be:
  1. Use git rebase -i c55769b but set the GIT_EDITOR environment variable to automatically edit the rebase todo list
  2. Or use git filter-branch to rewrite commit messages
  3. Or manually step through with git rebase --continue

  But honestly, the safest approach might be to ask you: What method would you prefer for amending these older commit messages? I want to make sure
  I use an approach you're comfortable with rather than risk messing up the commit history.

> I can myself interact with a rebase -i that I run, with your assistance. Will it not basically require editing text? Describe the steps for 
  changing just this earliest commit.

● Yes, exactly! git rebase -i will open a text editor where you can change pick to reword for specific commits. Here are the steps:

  1. Start interactive rebase:
  git rebase -i c55769b
  2. Edit the rebase todo list that opens in your editor. You'll see something like:
  pick fc15901 feat: add branch safety module
  pick 6d18e4f feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
  pick b5f965b feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
  pick be5ae40 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
  pick fe0a16d feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
  3. Change the first line from pick to reword:
  reword fc15901 feat: add branch safety module
  pick 6d18e4f feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
  pick b5f965b feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
  pick be5ae40 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
  pick fe0a16d feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
  4. Save and close the editor
  5. Git will then open another editor for you to edit the commit message of fc15901. Replace the message with my improved version.
  6. Save and close - the rebase will complete automatically.

  Would you like to try this approach?

> Yes.

  But this seems very fixable. We want the env.ts change in the most recent commit, the one we can amend. Then we want template.env and *.md 
  changes/untracked in a subsequent commit. **Lastly** we want to stash the new api changes.

● Let me follow your plan step by step:

  1. First, stash the test API routes:

● Bash(mv src/routes/api/test-edge-json /tmp/ && mv src/routes/api/test-edge /tmp/ && mv src/routes/api/test-svelte-pattern /tmp/)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Just don't touch them yet.

  The first step is to add env.ts and amend the latest commit to include it.

● You're right! Let me add env.ts to the most recent commit:

● Bash(git add src/lib/env.ts)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(git commit --amend --no-edit)
  ⎿  [l10-preview f9ac606] feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)

     … +13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The env.ts changes are now in the latest commit. Now let's create a new commit for the documentation changes:

● Bash(git add README.md template.env L10N.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(git commit -m "docs: comprehensive l10n documentation and environment updates…)
  ⎿  [l10-preview 7e1f574] docs: comprehensive l10n documentation and environment updates

     [STARTED] Backing up original state...
     … +13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now let's check the working directory status before doing the rebase:

● Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch l10-preview
     Your branch is ahead of 'origin/l10-preview' by 6 commits.
       (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

     … +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! Now we only have the untracked test API routes, which won't interfere with the rebase. Now you can run the interactive rebase:

  git rebase -i c55769b

  When the editor opens, you'll see the commits and should change the first line from pick to reword:

  reword fc15901 feat: add branch safety module
  pick 6d18e4f feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
  pick b5f965b feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
  pick be5ae40 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
  pick f9ac606 feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
  pick 7e1f574 docs: comprehensive l10n documentation and environment updates

  After saving that, git will open another editor for the commit message where you can paste the improved message I prepared earlier.

> I've acted as advised. Let's go on to reword 6d18e4f

● Perfect! Now let's work on the mode system commit (6d18e4f). Let me check what its current SHA is after the rebase:

● Bash(git log --oneline -8)
  ⎿  8a72fc1 docs: comprehensive l10n documentation and environment updates
     307b30c feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)

     38c1bb9 feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The mode system commit is now at b3a0327. Here's the improved commit message I prepared for the mode system commit:

  feat: implement l10n mode system with centralized determination

  Creates the Mode class implementing the three l10n operating modes:
  - en-only: No l10ns bothered, maximum speed (default for local dev)
  - dry-run: Uses captured l10ns only, no LLM calls (missing API key or --dry-run flag)
  - perform: Prompts LLMs to capture new l10ns into cage (valid API key + proper branch)

  Key features:
  - Centralized mode determination replacing scattered logic
  - Safe defaults prevent expensive operations in development
  - Clear mode announcements via mode.announce()
  - Branch safety integration for perform mode validation
  - Comprehensive test coverage (295 test lines, 100% coverage)

  See L10N.md "L10n Modes" section for behavior details.

  Now you can run:

  git rebase -i c55769b

  In the editor, change the line for commit b3a0327 from pick to reword:

  pick f78259d feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system
  reword b3a0327 feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing
  pick 38c1bb9 feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support
  pick 7678a29 refactor (terminology migration + using new features) (renames + some changes)
  pick 307b30c feat/refactor: (terminology migration + using new features) (remaining changes)
  pick 8a72fc1 docs: comprehensive l10n documentation and environment updates

  When git opens the commit message editor, replace it with the improved message above.

● Plan for Commit 9183fd8 (Force Mode)

  Key aspects to highlight:

  1. Selective retranslation capability - allows targeting specific files without regenerating everything
  2. Comprehensive glob pattern support - standard minimatch syntax with wildcards, character classes, brace expansion
  3. Developer-friendly CLI - helpful error messages and extensive help system
  4. Robust testing - 143 lines of integration tests against real filesystem
  5. Clean module extraction - dedicated force.ts module with clear API

  Improved commit message:
  feat: implement l10n force mode with comprehensive glob pattern support

  Enables selective retranslation of specific files using familiar glob patterns.
  Supports standard minimatch syntax including wildcards, character classes, and brace expansion.

  Usage examples:
  - `pnpm l10n --force "*.md"` - All markdown files
  - `pnpm l10n --force "2024-*"` - Files with specific prefix
  - `pnpm l10n --force "{join,donate}.md"` - Multiple specific files
  - `pnpm l10n --force en.json proposal.md` - Mixed file types

  Key features:
  - Clean module extraction in force.ts with resolve() function
  - Comprehensive help system with examples and syntax guide
  - Integration tests against real filesystem (143 test lines)
  - Proper CLI argument parsing (fixed minimist boolean handling)

  See L10N.md "Force Mode Patterns" section for complete syntax guide.

  This uses the L10N.md terminology ("retranslation", "recapturing") and highlights the practical developer benefits while noting the technical
  implementation details from the v2 plan.

● Plan for Commit 16344b6 (File Renames + Limited Changes)

  Key aspects to highlight:

  1. File renames and directory restructuring - scripts/translation/ → scripts/l10n/
  2. Strategic commit splitting - preserves git history by limiting changes per commit
  3. Core file renames - translate.ts → run.ts, translate-core.ts → heart.ts
  4. Terminology migration in affected files - but only basic changes to avoid breaking git rename detection
  5. Interim broken state - this commit intentionally doesn't build, fixed in next commit

  Improved commit message:
  refactor: l10n terminology migration part 1 (file renames + minimal changes)

  Migrates from "translation" to "l10n" terminology with strategic commit splitting
  to preserve git file history. Renames core files and directory structure:

  Directory migration:
  - scripts/translation/ → scripts/l10n/

  Key file renames:
  - translate.ts → run.ts (main entry point)
  - translate-core.ts → heart.ts (core l10n logic)
  - Keep git-ops.ts, prompts.ts, utils.ts, etc.

  Limited terminology updates in moved files to ensure git detects renames.
  Note: This intermediate state does not build - completed in next commit.

  Part of comprehensive terminology migration to "l10n cage" architecture.
  See L10N.md for the new terminology and concepts.

  This explains the git history preservation strategy, notes the intentional broken state, and references the L10N.md documentation for the new
  terminology.

● Plan for Commit 053a4ad (Final Integration)

  Key aspects to highlight:

  1. Complete terminology migration - all function names, variables, comments updated
  2. Integration of three new features - Mode system, Branch safety, Force mode fully integrated
  3. Simplified CLI - pnpm scripts streamlined, new CLI flags working
  4. Environment behavior change - includes our env.ts change for CI-based defaults
  5. Package dependencies - adds minimatch for force mode

  Based on the v2 plan and what I can see in the diff, here's the improved commit message:

  Improved commit message:
  feat: complete l10n terminology migration and integrate new features

  Completes the transition from "translation" to "l10n cage" architecture with
  full integration of the new Mode, Branch Safety, and Force systems.

  Terminology migration:
  - Function names: translate() → l10nFromLLM(), translateOrLoad*() → retrieve*()
  - Parameter names: languageTag → locale, translationOptions → options
  - Type names: TranslationOptions → Options, TargetStrategy → Targeting
  - Comments and documentation: Complete "l10n cage" terminology throughout
  - Environment variables: Uses L10N_OPENROUTER_API_KEY, L10N_BRANCH

  Feature integration:
  - Mode system: Integrated in run.ts with mode.announce() and safe defaults
  - Branch safety: Integrated l10nCageBranch() and pushWithUpstream()
  - Force mode: Added resolveForcePatterns() and --force CLI support

  CLI simplification:
  - Removed redundant pnpm scripts (l10n:dry-run, l10n:estimate, etc.)
  - Unified to `pnpm l10n` with --dry-run, --force, --verbose flags
  - Updated dev/build integration for automatic l10n invocation

  Environment improvements:
  - isDev() now uses CI detection instead of NODE_ENV for consistent local defaults
  - Cache location: l10n-cage/ replaces src/temp/translations/  
  - Package: Added minimatch dependency for glob pattern support

  See L10N.md for complete documentation of new architecture.

  This captures the comprehensive nature of this final commit, noting both the terminology migration completion and the integration of all three new
   feature systems, plus the environment behavior change.

  Ready for the final rebase?

> Look over the v2 plan, is there anything important to mention that we didn't find a home for?

● Read(../../../L10N_BRANCH_SAFETY_PLAN_v2.md)
  ⎿  Read 157 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Looking through the v2 plan, I notice several important points that we should check have been documented somewhere:

  Important Items to Verify:

  1. SSH Auto-detection and Switching (line 88)

  This is a significant technical improvement that should be mentioned somewhere. It automatically switches between HTTPS and SSH for Git
  operations.

  2. Critical CI API Key Security Fix (line 94)

  "Fixed critical CI API key security issue (no silent dry-run in CI)" - This is an important security fix that prevents CI from silently falling
  back to dry-run mode with invalid API keys.

  3. Upfront Credential Testing (line 89)

  The system now tests Git credentials before attempting operations to prevent failed commits.

  4. Automatic Inlang Settings Regeneration (line 97)

  For bootstrap scenarios - this ensures the system can self-configure.

  5. Unit Test Coverage (line 24)

  The Mode system has "100% coverage" which is worth highlighting.

  6. Removed isDev() auto-dry-run logic (line 31)

  This is a behavior change that affects how the system operates.

  7. _postbuild:l10ntamer target (line 78)

  This handles post-build tasks but wasn't mentioned in our commit messages.

  8. Later Refinements Section (lines 126-149)

  The Mode Factory Pattern and Branch Maintenance Strategy are documented as future work but might be worth mentioning in L10N.md.

  Most of these are technical implementation details that are captured in the code but might benefit from mentions in:
  - L10N.md troubleshooting section (credential testing, SSH auto-switch)
  - L10N.md production considerations (CI security fix)
  - Commit messages (some of these could enhance the existing messages)

  Should we add any of these details to the documentation or are they sufficiently covered by the implementation?

> 1. reword the branch safety commit to include (also see items 2 and 3)
  2. it really wasn't so "critical" but we can mention the behavior in the same reword: it's part of the branch safety decision
  3. mention this briefly in same reword too.
  4. eh, ignore, it being missing in earlier translate.ts scripts was a now obsolete bug
  5. ignore, we already overhyped comprehensive testing
  6. reword the mode commit to include if it isn't already covered (relatedly, we did mention the isDev=!CI env.ts change in the relevant commit?) 
  7. ignore, the main point is already in the earlier commit that added the validating script
  8. ignore, they are in CLAUDE.md

● You're right! Let me check what we already have in the commits and then update them accordingly.

● Bash(git log --format="%h %s" -8)

     Commit: Anthony Bailey <mail@anthonybailey.net>

     … +16 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good, the env.ts change IS mentioned in the final commit. Now I need to:

  1. Update the branch safety commit to include SSH auto-detection, CI security behavior, and credential testing
  2. Update the mode system commit to mention removal of isDev() auto-dry-run logic

  Let me start another rebase:

  git rebase -i c55769b

  For the branch safety commit (f78259d), here's the updated message:

  feat: implement l10n cage branch safety system

  Prevents accidental writes to production l10n cage from local development while
  supporting CI/CD workflows. Implements dynamic branch detection with fallbacks:
  - L10N_BRANCH environment override
  - CI environment detection (Netlify PR previews, branch deploys)  
  - Current git branch as fallback

  Key safety features:
  - Blocks local development writes to main cage branch
  - Tests git authentication upfront to prevent failed commits
  - SSH auto-detection and switching for seamless Git operations
  - CI environments never silently fall back to dry-run with invalid API keys
  - Automatic branch creation and upstream tracking
  - Comprehensive test coverage (114 test lines)

  See L10N.md "Branch Safety System" section for usage.

  For the mode system commit (9f7f0f6), here's the updated message:

  feat: implement l10n mode system with centralized determination

  Creates the Mode class implementing the three l10n operating modes:
  - en-only: No l10ns bothered, maximum speed (default for local dev)
  - dry-run: Uses captured l10ns only, no LLM calls (missing API key or --dry-run flag)
  - perform: Prompts LLMs to capture new l10ns into cage (valid API key + proper branch)

  Key features:
  - Centralized mode determination replacing scattered logic
  - Removed isDev() auto-dry-run behavior for explicit control
  - Safe defaults prevent expensive operations in development
  - Clear mode announcements via mode.announce()
  - Branch safety integration for perform mode validation
  - Comprehensive test coverage (295 test lines, 100% coverage)

  See L10N.md "L10n Modes" section for behavior details.

  These updated messages now include the SSH auto-detection, CI security behavior, credential testing, and the removal of isDev() auto-dry-run
  logic.
