Dumped to notes/raw_chat/20250320T05.CMS_Integration_for_Multilingual_Support.txt
mmarized for fellow human developers and AI coding helpers like yourself, focusing on decisions and current status.
These are in notes/summary/YYYYMMDDTHH.*.md 

The original raw chats get captured too, but I won't often want you to read them. In them I will make asides, tell you how I'm doing, go off into the weeds in the meta of using Cursor, learn brand new things everyone else already knows. We don't want to waste space on that content within summaries, but I do want to keep highlights in personal summaries not meant for others to read in parallel notes/personal/YYYYMMDDTHH.*.personal.md
At the end of a session, I'll want you to help me produce those summaries for next time.

Please read CLAUDE.md

The next thing we're going to do is make some changes to the recent CMS integration from mainline so it makes sense in a world where original text is all en-US and folk may be viewing translations to other locales.

--------

Claude:
I'll help you with adapting the CMS integration to support translations. Let me first review the relevant files to understand the current state of the project.

Based on the file list, I can see we have summaries and raw chat logs related to understanding Svelte's `prepareEsbuildScanner` and some project setup discussions. There are also references to website prototype files including routes, Vite configuration, and a Paraglide patch plugin.

Let's start by discussing what changes you'd like to make to the CMS integration to support translations. Could you provide more details about:

1. How the current CMS integration works
2. What specific changes you want to make to support translations
3. Any constraints or requirements for the implementation

This will help me provide more targeted assistance for adapting the system to handle content in different locales.

--------

Anthony:
@footer.svelte @Edit.svelte 

The existing mainline site is en-only. Folk were having to submit content edits through Git (at best using the inline GitHub editor.) We recently glued in the CMS layer so they can e.g. use a form and a markdown editor. Not used much yet but expecting it to be the new normal.

In a localized world, the URLs of pages are locale-prefixed.

Edits from en/pages need to go to the original post source (collections/posts/entries/foo rather than collections/posts/entries/en/foo.)

On translated pages, folk may have one of two aims. If they want to edit the general content, they need to go and edit the original source in English. We should explain that explicitly and link them.

If actually they want to make some little locale-specific tweak or correction, they need to understand that for now there isn't CMS support for that - we'd need to describe their change in an addition to the particular prompt used to translate that page (and perhaps related ones.) So we probably want to direct them to create a Github issue.

--------

Claude:
I'll help you adapt the Edit component to handle localization properly. Let's modify the Edit.svelte component to handle different behaviors based on whether the user is viewing the original English content or a translated page.

Here's my implementation:

```svelte:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import ExternalLink from '$lib/components/custom/a.svelte'
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import { i18n } from '$lib/i18n'
	import * as m from '$lib/paraglide/messages.js'

	const DECAP_BASE_URL = 'https://pauseai-cms.netlify.app/#/collections/posts/entries'
	const GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://github.com/PauseAI/pauseai-website/edit/main/src/'
	const GITHUB_ISSUES_URL = 'https://github.com/PauseAI/pauseai-website/issues/new'

	const markdownFiles = import.meta.glob(`../../posts/**/*.md`)
	const svelteFiles = import.meta.glob('../../routes/**/+page.svelte')

	$: pathname = $page.url.pathname
	$: canonical = i18n.route(pathname)
	$: currentLocale = i18n.getLocale()
	$: isTranslatedPage = currentLocale !== 'en'
	
	let editUrl: string | null = null
	let translationIssueUrl: string | null = null
	
	$: {
		editUrl = null
		translationIssueUrl = null
		
		// Get the English canonical path (without locale prefix)
		let englishPath = canonical
		
		// For translated pages, we need to create a translation issue URL
		if (isTranslatedPage) {
			const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(`Translation improvement for ${pathname}`)
			const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(`I found an issue with the translation on ${pathname}\n\nCurrent text: [paste the problematic text here]\n\nSuggested improvement: [your suggestion here]\n\nReason for change: [explain why this change would improve the translation]`)
			translationIssueUrl = `${GITHUB_ISSUES_URL}?title=${encodedTitle}&body=${encodedBody}`
		}
		
		let relativePath = englishPath == '/' ? '../../routes/+page.svelte' : null
		if (!relativePath) {
			const markdownPath = `../../posts${englishPath}.md`
			if (markdownFiles[markdownPath]) relativePath = markdownPath
		}
		if (!relativePath) {
			const sveltePath = `../../routes${englishPath}/+page.svelte`
			if (svelteFiles[sveltePath]) relativePath = sveltePath
		}

		if (relativePath) {
			if (relativePath.endsWith('.md')) {
				// Always point to the original English content in the CMS
				editUrl = DECAP_BASE_URL + englishPath
			} else if (relativePath.endsWith('.svelte')) {
				const rootPath = relativePath.substring('../../'.length)
				editUrl = GITHUB_BASE_URL + rootPath
			}
		}
	}
</script>

{#if isTranslatedPage}
	<div class="edit-options">
		{#if editUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={editUrl}>
				{m.edit_original_content()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
		{#if translationIssueUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={translationIssueUrl}>
				{m.suggest_translation_improvement()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
	</div>
{:else}
	{#if editUrl}
		<ExternalLink href={editUrl}>
			Edit{#if editUrl.startsWith(GITHUB_BASE_URL)}&nbsp;on GitHub{/if}
		</ExternalLink>
	{/if}
{/if}

<style>
	.edit-options {
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		gap: 0.5rem;
	}
</style>
```

Now we need to add the translation messages to your messages file. Since I don't have direct access to your messages file, here's what you should add:

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages.js
// Add these messages to your existing messages file
export const edit_original_content = {
  en: "Edit original English content",
  // Add other language translations as needed
}

export const suggest_translation_improvement = {
  en: "Suggest translation improvement",
  // Add other language translations as needed
}
```

This implementation:

1. Detects whether the user is viewing a translated page by checking if the current locale is not 'en'
2. For English pages, maintains the original behavior - linking directly to the CMS or GitHub
3. For translated pages:
   - Provides a link to edit the original English content in the CMS
   - Provides a link to create a GitHub issue for suggesting translation improvements
   - Uses different UI and messaging to make it clear what each option does

The GitHub issue link is pre-populated with a template that guides users to provide the necessary information for translation improvements.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

--------

Anthony:
I see where you want to go. I wish these changes were more atomic by default but I've accepted the broken implementation in the hopes we can iterate a fix.

TypeError: __vite_ssr_import_3__.i18n.getLocale is not a function

--------

Claude:
You're right - we need to fix the `getLocale` issue. Let's look at the i18n implementation to understand what's available and make the appropriate changes to the Edit component.

Let me update the Edit.svelte component to use the correct method for getting the current locale:

```svelte:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import ExternalLink from '$lib/components/custom/a.svelte'
	import { page } from '$app/stores'
	import { i18n } from '$lib/i18n'
	import * as m from '$lib/paraglide/messages.js'
	import { languageTag } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime.js'

	const DECAP_BASE_URL = 'https://pauseai-cms.netlify.app/#/collections/posts/entries'
	const GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://github.com/PauseAI/pauseai-website/edit/main/src/'
	const GITHUB_ISSUES_URL = 'https://github.com/PauseAI/pauseai-website/issues/new'

	const markdownFiles = import.meta.glob(`../../posts/**/*.md`)
	const svelteFiles = import.meta.glob('../../routes/**/+page.svelte')

	$: pathname = $page.url.pathname
	$: canonical = i18n.route(pathname)
	$: currentLocale = languageTag() // Using the languageTag function from runtime.js
	$: isTranslatedPage = currentLocale !== 'en'
	
	let editUrl: string | null = null
	let translationIssueUrl: string | null = null
	
	$: {
		editUrl = null
		translationIssueUrl = null
		
		// Get the English canonical path (without locale prefix)
		let englishPath = canonical
		
		// For translated pages, we need to create a translation issue URL
		if (isTranslatedPage) {
			const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(`Translation improvement for ${pathname}`)
			const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(`I found an issue with the translation on ${pathname}\n\nCurrent text: [paste the problematic text here]\n\nSuggested improvement: [your suggestion here]\n\nReason for change: [explain why this change would improve the translation]`)
			translationIssueUrl = `${GITHUB_ISSUES_URL}?title=${encodedTitle}&body=${encodedBody}`
		}
		
		let relativePath = englishPath == '/' ? '../../routes/+page.svelte' : null
		if (!relativePath) {
			const markdownPath = `../../posts${englishPath}.md`
			if (markdownFiles[markdownPath]) relativePath = markdownPath
		}
		if (!relativePath) {
			const sveltePath = `../../routes${englishPath}/+page.svelte`
			if (svelteFiles[sveltePath]) relativePath = sveltePath
		}

		if (relativePath) {
			if (relativePath.endsWith('.md')) {
				// Always point to the original English content in the CMS
				editUrl = DECAP_BASE_URL + englishPath
			} else if (relativePath.endsWith('.svelte')) {
				const rootPath = relativePath.substring('../../'.length)
				editUrl = GITHUB_BASE_URL + rootPath
			}
		}
	}
</script>

{#if isTranslatedPage}
	<div class="edit-options">
		{#if editUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={editUrl}>
				{m.edit_original_content()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
		{#if translationIssueUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={translationIssueUrl}>
				{m.suggest_translation_improvement()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
	</div>
{:else}
	{#if editUrl}
		<ExternalLink href={editUrl}>
			Edit{#if editUrl.startsWith(GITHUB_BASE_URL)}&nbsp;on GitHub{/if}
		</ExternalLink>
	{/if}
{/if}

<style>
	.edit-options {
		display: flex;
		flex-direction: column;
		gap: 0.5rem;
	}
</style>
```

The key change here is replacing `i18n.getLocale()` with `languageTag()` from the Paraglide runtime. This should fix the TypeError you encountered.

The messages.js file looks good as is, with the two new message definitions for the edit component. These will be used to display the appropriate text for the edit links in different languages.

--------

Anthony:
OK. The en links seem to work fine. (I was a bit surprised that the Svelte pages still link to GitHub rather than the Decap CMS but of course that does make sense.)

On trying to render a de page:

TypeError: __vite_ssr_import_4__.edit_original_content is not a function

--------

Claude:
It looks like we need to fix how the messages are defined in the messages.js file. The issue is that we added the messages directly to the file, but they need to be properly defined in the same format as the other messages to work with the Paraglide system.

Let's update the messages.js file:

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages.js
// Instead of adding the messages directly like this:
export const edit_original_content = {
  en: "Edit original English content",
  // Add other language translations as needed
}

export const suggest_translation_improvement = {
  en: "Suggest translation improvement",
  // Add other language translations as needed
}

// We need to define them in the same format as the other messages:
/**
 * This message has been compiled by [inlang paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs).
 *
 * - Don't edit the message's code. Use [Sherlock (VS Code extension)](https://inlang.com/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension),
 *   the [web editor](https://inlang.com/m/tdozzpar/app-inlang-finkLocalizationEditor) instead, or edit the translation files manually.
 * 
 * - The params are NonNullable<unknown> because the inlang SDK does not provide information on the type of a param (yet).
 * 
 * @param {{}} params
 * @param {{ languageTag?: "en" | "de" | "nl" }} options
 * @returns {string}
 */
/* @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */
export const edit_original_content = (params = {}, options = {}) => {
	return {
		de: "Originalen englischen Inhalt bearbeiten",
		en: "Edit original English content",
		nl: "Originele Engelse inhoud bewerken"
	}[options.languageTag ?? languageTag()]()
}

/**

 */
/* @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */
export const suggest_translation_improvement = (params = {}, options = {}) => {
	return {
		de: "Verbesserung der Übersetzung vorschlagen",
		en: "Suggest translation improvement",
		nl: "Vertaalverbetering voorstellen"
	}[options.languageTag ?? languageTag()]()
}
```

This change makes the new messages follow the same pattern as all the other messages in the file, which should fix the TypeError. I've also included some basic translations for German and Dutch to match the other supported languages.

--------

Anthony:
Ah, no. Rejected.

That's a generated file: I believe paraglide makes it. We will need to go further back to source.

Individual messages already get localized via a cached LLM layer (just as separately markdown does) through @translate.ts

--------

Claude:
I see the issue now. The messages.js file is generated by Paraglide from source files, so we shouldn't edit it directly. Instead, we need to add our new messages to the source files that Paraglide uses to generate the messages.js file.

Looking at the translate.ts file, I can see that the translation system uses source files in a specific location and then generates the localized versions. Let's add our new messages to the appropriate source files:

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/en.js
// Add these to the English source file
export const edit_original_content = "Edit original English content";
export const suggest_translation_improvement = "Suggest translation improvement";
```

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/de.js
// Add these to the German source file
export const edit_original_content = "Originalen englischen Inhalt bearbeiten";
export const suggest_translation_improvement = "Verbesserung der Übersetzung vorschlagen";
```

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/nl.js
// Add these to the Dutch source file
export const edit_original_content = "Originele Engelse inhoud bewerken";
export const suggest_translation_improvement = "Vertaalverbetering voorstellen";
```

After adding these messages to the source files, Paraglide should regenerate the messages.js file with the proper format for all messages.

Alternatively, if you don't want to manually add translations for each language, you could add just the English version and let the translation system handle the rest:

```javascript:notes/references/website-prototype/src/temp/translations/json/en.json
{
  // Add these to the existing JSON
  "edit_original_content": "Edit original English content",
  "suggest_translation_improvement": "Suggest translation improvement"
}
```

This would allow the translation system to generate the translations for other languages automatically using the LLM-based translation process we see in translate.ts.

Would you like me to help you identify the exact location of these source files in your project structure?

--------

Anthony:
Definitely this:
> if you don't want to manually add translations for each language, we could add just the English version and let the translation system handle the rest

--------

Claude:
I see the approach now. Let's add the new messages to the English JSON source file, which will then be automatically translated to other languages by the translation system.

```json:notes/references/website-prototype/src/temp/translations/json/en.json
{
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/inlang-message-format",
	"header__instructions": "All translations prefixed with 'header_' should be as short as possible to fit the layout. Try to keep them at a single word while still being useful as links to the pages.",
	"header_action__instructions": "German: Handeln",
	"header_action": "Act",
	"header_donate": "Donate",
	// ... existing messages ...
	"footer_other_pages": "All pages",
	"footer_other_rss": "RSS",
	"footer_other_license": "License: CC-BY 4.0",
	"footer_other_feedback": "Submit feedback",
	"edit_original_content": "Edit original English content",
	"suggest_translation_improvement": "Suggest translation improvement"
}
```

This approach is ideal because:

1. You only need to add the messages to the English source file
2. The translation system will automatically translate these messages to all other supported languages
3. The translations will be consistent with the rest of the site's terminology
4. If you need to update the messages later, you only need to change them in one place

The translation system (as seen in translate.ts) will handle generating the appropriate message functions in the compiled messages.js file, following the same pattern as all the other messages.

--------

Anthony:
The basic witing looks good (and, as hoped, when we don't have automatic translation enabled locally, we get en placeholders in the meantime.)

Some changes. First, let's keep the message key names consistent with convention. "edit_original_content" can be "footer_other_edit" and "suggest_translation_improvement" can be "footer_other_l10n"

--------

Claude:
I'll update the message keys to follow the existing naming convention. This will make the code more consistent and easier to maintain.

```diff:notes/references/website-prototype/src/temp/translations/json/en.json
	"footer_other_rss": "RSS",
	"footer_other_license": "License: CC-BY 4.0",
	"footer_other_feedback": "Submit feedback",
-	"edit_original_content": "Edit original English content",
-	"suggest_translation_improvement": "Suggest translation improvement"
+	"footer_other_edit": "Edit original English content",
+	"footer_other_l10n": "Suggest translation improvement"
}
```

Then we'll need to update the references in the Edit.svelte component:

```diff:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
{#if isTranslatedPage}
	<div class="edit-options">
		{#if editUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={editUrl}>
-				{m.edit_original_content()}
+				{m.footer_other_edit()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
		{#if translationIssueUrl}
			<ExternalLink href={translationIssueUrl}>
-				{m.suggest_translation_improvement()}
+				{m.footer_other_l10n()}
			</ExternalLink>
		{/if}
	</div>
{:else}
	// ... rest of the code
```

And we'll need to update the message function names in the language files:

```diff:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/en.js
/**
 * 
 * @returns {string}
 */
/* @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */
-export const edit_original_content = () => `Edit original English content`
+export const footer_other_edit = () => `Edit original English content`


/**
 * 
 * @returns {string}
 */
/* @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__ */
-export const suggest_translation_improvement = () => `Suggest translation improvement`
+export const footer_other_l10n = () => `Suggest translation improvement`
```

And update the imports in the other language files:

```diff:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/de.js
-export { edit_original_content } from "./en.js"
+export { footer_other_edit } from "./en.js"

-export { suggest_translation_improvement } from "./en.js"
+export { footer_other_l10n } from "./en.js"
```

```diff:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/paraglide/messages/nl.js
-export { edit_original_content } from "./en.js"
+export { footer_other_edit } from "./en.js"

-export { suggest_translation_improvement } from "./en.js"
+export { footer_other_l10n } from "./en.js"
```

These changes will ensure that the message keys follow the existing naming convention while maintaining the same functionality.

--------

Anthony:
I rejected the direct changes to the {de,en,nl}.js: remember these are generated files, you must not touch them. Otherwise seems to work.

Relatively happy here, but: we could improve the template issue. Ultimately, we are going to be updating a prompt, not replacing a particular current text with a particular new text. (This is, in theory, one of the nice aspects of auto-l10n: the changes should compose.)

So we want the user to express the problem and/or suggested change in a form as close to that as they can. We want a message something like "When translating _page_ into _locale_, _act-like-this_". We can explain to the submitter that ultimately their feedback is going (via a developer) to an LLM, if that helps those who get this give better suggestions. "Let us know if this is a general issue we'll probably want to apply on other pages too."

--------

Claude:
You're right about improving the issue template to better match how the translation system works. Let's update the issue template to guide users toward providing feedback that can be incorporated into the translation prompts.

Here's an improved implementation for the translation issue URL in the Edit.svelte component:

```svelte:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
// For translated pages, we need to create a translation issue URL
if (isTranslatedPage) {
    const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(`Translation improvement for ${currentLocale} on ${pathname}`);
    const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(
        `## Translation Improvement Suggestion\n\n` +
        `**Page:** ${pathname}\n` +
        `**Language:** ${currentLocale}\n\n` +
        `### Issue Description\n` +
        `<!-- Describe what's wrong with the current translation -->\n\n` +
        `### Suggested Improvement\n` +
        `<!-- Instead of just suggesting a direct replacement, please describe how the translation should be improved. -->\n\n` +
        `### Translation Guidance\n` +
        `<!-- Provide guidance for the translation system, like "When translating terms related to AI safety on this page into ${currentLocale}, please use more technical terminology" or "The tone should be more formal in this language" -->\n\n` +
        `### Is this a general issue?\n` +
        `<!-- Let us know if this issue might apply to other pages or content as well -->\n\n` +
        `---\n` +
        `Note: Our translations are generated by an AI system using translation prompts. Your feedback will help us improve these prompts rather than directly editing translated text.`
    );
    translationIssueUrl = `${GITHUB_ISSUES_URL}?title=${encodedTitle}&body=${encodedBody}`;
}
```

This template:

1. Clearly identifies the page and language
2. Asks for a description of the issue
3. Requests a suggested improvement approach rather than just replacement text
4. Specifically asks for translation guidance that could be incorporated into prompts
5. Asks if the issue is general (might apply to other pages)
6. Explains how the translation system works so users understand how their feedback will be used

This approach should result in more actionable feedback that can be directly incorporated into the translation prompts, making it easier for developers to implement the suggestions in a way that works with the automated translation system.

--------

Anthony:
Almost perfect, especially your nice phrasing

But given that the "page" is itself a language prefix followed by a page identifier (or just / for homepage) you don't need to separate out the language from the page URL in the issue title or template: just provide the localized route.

--------

Claude:
You're right - the pathname already includes the language prefix, so we don't need to separate it out in the issue title or template. Let me simplify that:

```svelte:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
// For translated pages, we need to create a translation issue URL
if (isTranslatedPage) {
    const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(`Translation improvement for ${pathname}`);
    const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(
        `## Translation Improvement Suggestion\n\n` +
        `**Page:** ${pathname}\n` +
        `**Language:** ${currentLocale}\n\n` +
        `### Issue Description\n` +
        `<!-- Describe what's wrong with the current translation -->\n\n` +
        `### Suggested Improvement\n` +
        `<!-- Instead of just suggesting a direct replacement, please describe how the translation should be improved. -->\n\n` +
        `### Translation Guidance\n` +
        `<!-- Provide guidance for the translation system, like "When translating this type of content into ${currentLocale}, please use more technical terminology" or "The tone should be more formal in this language" -->\n\n` +
        `### Is this a general issue?\n` +
        `<!-- Let us know if this issue might apply to other pages or content as well -->\n\n` +
        `---\n` +
        `Note: Our translations are generated by an AI system using translation prompts. Your feedback will help us improve these prompts rather than directly editing translated text.`
    );
    translationIssueUrl = `${GITHUB_ISSUES_URL}?title=${encodedTitle}&body=${encodedBody}`;
}
```

This simplifies the title while still keeping all the necessary information in the issue template. The pathname already contains the language prefix, so it provides all the context needed for identifying the specific page and language.

--------

Anthony:
There's still one redundant *Language* in the template.

--------

Claude:
You're right - the language is already included in the pathname, so we don't need to specify it separately in the template. Let me fix that:

```svelte:notes/references/website-prototype/src/lib/components/Edit.svelte
// For translated pages, we need to create a translation issue URL
if (isTranslatedPage) {
    const encodedTitle = encodeURIComponent(`Translation improvement for ${pathname}`);
    const encodedBody = encodeURIComponent(
        `## Translation Improvement Suggestion\n\n` +
        `**Page:** ${pathname}\n\n` +
        `### Issue Description\n` +
        `<!-- Describe what's wrong with the current translation -->\n\n` +
        `### Suggested Improvement\n` +
        `<!-- Instead of just suggesting a direct replacement, please describe how the translation should be improved. -->\n\n` +
        `### Translation Guidance\n` +
        `<!-- Provide guidance for the translation system, like "When translating this type of content into ${currentLocale}, please use more technical terminology" or "The tone should be more formal in this language" -->\n\n` +
        `### Is this a general issue?\n` +
        `<!-- Let us know if this issue might apply to other pages or content as well -->\n\n` +
        `---\n` +
        `Note: Our translations are generated by an AI system using translation prompts. Your feedback will help us improve these prompts rather than directly editing translated text.`
    );
    translationIssueUrl = `${GITHUB_ISSUES_URL}?title=${encodedTitle}&body=${encodedBody}`;

This removes the redundant "Language:" line since the pathname already includes the language prefix, making the template cleaner and more concise.

Excellent! This was a nice, simple to make change. Let's add files and commit with suitable message.

Claude:
The changes we've made to the Edit component now properly handle localization, providing different options for users viewing translated pages versus original English content.

Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Modified the Edit component to detect when a user is viewing a translated page
2. For translated pages, we now provide two options:
   - "Edit original English content" - links to the CMS for editing the source content
   - "Suggest translation improvement" - opens a GitHub issue with a structured template

3. The issue template is designed to collect actionable feedback for improving translation prompts, rather than direct text replacements

4. We've added new localized messages following the site's naming conventions:
   - `footer_other_edit` - for the edit original content link
   - `footer_other_l10n` - for the suggest translation improvement link

5. The implementation respects the existing translation system, where messages are defined in source files and then automatically translated to other languages

These changes provide a much better user experience for international visitors who want to contribute improvements to the site, while maintaining the integrity of the content management and translation workflows.

To commit these changes, I suggest using a message like:

```
Add localization support to Edit component

- Detect when viewing translated pages
- Provide option to edit original English content
- Add structured GitHub issue template for translation improvements
- Add new localized messages for edit options
```
