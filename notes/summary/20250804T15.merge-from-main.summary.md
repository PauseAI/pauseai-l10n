# Session Summary: Merge from Main
**Date**: 2025-01-04
**Branch**: pausecon_write_deep_mind
**Purpose**: Merge latest main branch changes into feature branch

## What Was Done

1. **Committed WIP changes** to preserve data-attribute migration work
   - Stage 1 (discover) migrated to DOM-driven pattern
   - Stages 2-5 still using array-based system

2. **Merged main branch** (112 new commits since branch diverged)
   - Resolved conflicts in:
     - `package.json`: Took newer dependency versions from main
     - `svelte.config.js`: Removed dead adapter-patch-prerendered wrapper, kept `split: true`
     - `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Regenerated after package.json resolution

3. **Key changes from main**:
   - ESLint upgrade to v9
   - Node version requirement: v20+ (project uses v24.2.0 via .nvmrc)
   - UK MP email builder feature added
   - Various dependency updates
   - Removal of unused code (adapter-patch-prerendered, Countdown component, etc.)

## Technical Notes

- **Node/pnpm version management**: Project uses `.nvmrc` (v24.2.0) and packageManager field (pnpm@9.14.4)
- **Claude Code limitation**: Each Bash command runs in new shell, so `nvm use` doesn't persist between commands
- **Merge commit**: Temporary housekeeping - will be cleaned up before final PR

## Current State

- Branch successfully merged with main
- All conflicts resolved
- Ready for continued development on data-attribute migration
- Migration status: Stage 1 complete, Stages 2-5 pending

## Next Steps

- Continue data-attribute migration for remaining stages
- Address timeout issue for web search functionality (needs background function implementation)
- Regular merges from main every 2-3 days to avoid complex conflicts

## Documentation Updates

Added "Git Branch Hygiene" section to global CLAUDE.md to remind about regular merges from main when working on long-lived branches.
