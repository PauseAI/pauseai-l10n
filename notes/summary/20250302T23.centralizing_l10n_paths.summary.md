# Centralizing Localization Paths

## Summary
Applied a stashed Git changeset to the website prototype that centralizes localization path management. This change improves code organization and prevents confusing errors when running the dev server without first building localization files.

## Key Points

### Path Centralization Implementation
- Applied a stashed changeset named "l10n-paths" to the working copy
- Created a centralized path configuration file at `src/lib/l10n-paths.ts`
- Updated references in `scripts/translation/translate.ts`, `src/lib/i18n.ts`, and `vite.config.ts`
- Added server validation to ensure localization directories exist before starting the dev server
- Committed and pushed changes to the paraglide branch

### Build Process Improvement Opportunities
- Identified excessive verbosity in the build process even when no translations change
- Noted potential performance issues with sequential processing of markdown files
- Recognized warnings that could be addressed in future work
- Considered parallelization opportunities to speed up the build

## Next Steps
1. Verify Netlify deployment preview functions correctly
2. Investigate reducing build verbosity and optimizing performance
3. Address warnings displayed during the build process
4. Continue implementing the parallelized comparison approach from CLAUDE.md
