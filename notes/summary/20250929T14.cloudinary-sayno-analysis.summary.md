# Session Summary: Cloudinary API Analysis for Sayno Campaign
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Focus**: Analyzing Cloudinary image assets for sayno campaign (rebranded from selfie)

## Current Status

Successfully analyzed Cloudinary account structure and identified bulk download approach for approved sayno campaign images. All 156 sayno folder images are uniformly sized at 1500x2000px due to automatic transformation.

## Key Findings

### Asset Distribution (2025-09-29)
- **Total account**: 236 images
  - sayno: 156 (145 approved, 11 rejected)
  - cloudinary: 60 (example assets)
  - test_prototype: 20 (older test images)
- **Email capture rate**: 90% in sayno folder

### Technical Discoveries

1. **Upload Preset Transformation**
   - Preset "selfie" enforces 1500x2000px with face-aware cropping
   - All EXIF/GPS data stripped (privacy feature)
   - Original dimensions not preserved in metadata

2. **API Behavior**
   - `asset_folder=sayno` parameter unreliable with metadata flags
   - Tag filtering (`/resources/image/tags/{tag}`) works correctly
   - Must fetch all and filter locally for complex criteria

3. **Bulk Download Implementation**
   - Existing ZIP uses `use_original_filename: true` (collision risk)
   - Recommendation: Use `public_ids` for guaranteed uniqueness
   - 145 approved images = ~29.6MB ZIP file

## Decisions Made

1. **Use public_id naming** for ZIP downloads to prevent filename collisions
2. **Local filtering preferred** over complex API parameters
3. **Privacy-first approach** maintained (no GPS data retention)

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing explicit opt-in for location data if regional grouping needed
- Update ZIP generation to use public_ids instead of display names
- Monitor for filename collisions as campaign grows

## Lessons Learned

Critical importance of verifying cache timestamps - initial analysis used 4-day-old data showing only 49 images when 156 actually existed. Always validate data freshness when analyzing dynamic content.
