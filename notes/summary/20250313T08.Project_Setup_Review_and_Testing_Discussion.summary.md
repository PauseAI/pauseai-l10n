# Project Setup Review and Testing Discussion - Technical Summary

## Problem Statement
We identified an issue with the Paraglide runtime file patching process in the website prototype. The key problem was in the sequence of operations during development and build modes:

1. In dev mode: The runtime.js file is created by the Paraglide plugin when Vite's dev server starts
2. In build mode: The runtime.js file needs to be explicitly compiled before patching

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in vite.config.ts correctly handles the dev mode by:
1. Starting the Vite dev server
2. Waiting for the server to be in the "listening" state
3. Running the patch-paraglide-runtime.js script after a short delay

However, the build scripts in package.json were missing the explicit compilation step before patching.

## Solution
The recommended solution is to update the build scripts in package.json to explicitly compile the Paraglide runtime before patching:

```json
"build": "run-s setup:build translate && pnpm paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang && pnpm patch-paraglide --build && vite build --emptyOutDir=false && run-p _postbuild:*",
"build:fast": "run-s setup:build translate && pnpm paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang && pnpm patch-paraglide --build && VITE_DISABLE_SOURCEMAPS=1 vite build --emptyOutDir=false && run-p _postbuild:*",
"build:dev": "run-s setup:build && pnpm paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang && pnpm patch-paraglide --build && vite build --mode development && run-s _postbuild:*"
```

This ensures that:
1. The Paraglide runtime is compiled before patching in build mode
2. The patch script is run with the `--build` flag to indicate build mode
3. The existing dev mode workflow remains unchanged

## Status and Next Steps
- The dev mode workflow is working correctly and should be left as is
- The build scripts need to be updated to include the explicit compilation step
- No changes are needed to the patch-paraglide-runtime.js script itself
- The setup.js script should be simplified to focus on directory creation and environment setup

## Implementation Details
- The patch-paraglide-runtime.js script already has logic to handle both dev and build modes
- The vite.config.ts file correctly handles the dev mode workflow
- The setup.js script should be kept simple and focused on directory creation and environment setup
- The languageTags property in the paraglide plugin configuration in vite.config.ts may cause a linter error but is likely needed for functionality
