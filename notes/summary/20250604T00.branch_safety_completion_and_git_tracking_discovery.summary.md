# Branch Safety Completion & Git Tracking Discovery

**Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Session Focus**: Complete branch safety work, run actual scripts to find errors, discover git tracking issues

## Major Accomplishments

### Code Quality & Consistency Improvements

**L10n Terminology Migration Completion**:
- Fixed remaining "translat" references throughout codebase using `sed` for bulk operations
- Updated `test-branch-safety.ts`: `getTranslationBranch` → `getL10nBranch`, `TRANSLATION_BRANCH` → `L10N_BRANCH`
- Updated `test-mode.ts`: Fixed outdated mode expectations (`read-only` → `dry-run`)
- Updated `inlang-settings.ts`: Fixed import paths and function names (`setupTranslationRepo` → `setupL10nCage`)
- Updated `clean.ts`: Fixed import path (`./translation/utils` → `./l10n/utils`)

**Constants & Naming Consistency**:
- Renamed `L10NS_BASE_DIR` → `L10N_CAGE_DIR` across entire codebase
- Updated 8+ files with proper constant references using `sed` for efficiency
- Fixed git client naming: `cacheGit` → `cageGit`, `mainGit` → `websiteGit`
- Updated parameter names: `cacheGitCwd` → `cageWorkingDir`, `cachePathFromCwd` → `cageRelativePath` (inlined)
- Fixed Maps: `cacheLatestCommitDates` → `cageLatestCommitDates`, `mainLatestCommitDates` → `websiteLatestCommitDates`

**Force Module Enhancement**:
- Extracted force help UI from `run.ts` to `force.ts` as `showForceHelp()` function
- Kept single-line help reference in `run.ts` for consistency
- Improved module organization and separation of concerns

**Clean Script Safety**:
- Implemented `hasEndangeredL10ns()` function in `git-ops.ts` 
- Detects uncommitted changes and unpushed commits in l10n cage
- Shows detailed file status (modified/added/deleted) and recent commit messages
- Clean script now protects against data loss with clear error messages
- Uses consistent constant naming (`L10N_CAGE_DIR`) in error messages

### Critical Security Fix

**CI API Key Validation Issue**:
- **Problem Discovered**: CI was silently falling back to dry-run mode with invalid/missing API keys
- **Security Risk**: Builds would appear successful but no l10ns would be generated
- **Root Cause**: Mode logic allowed dry-run fallback in CI environments
- **Solution Implemented**: Modified mode determination logic in `mode.ts`:
  ```typescript
  // OLD: const shouldDryRun = this.options.isDryRun || !hasValidApiKey
  // NEW: const shouldDryRun = this.options.isDryRun || (!hasValidApiKey && !this.isCI)
  ```
- **Result**: CI with invalid API keys now goes to `perform` mode → fails loudly when LLM calls fail
- **Test Added**: Comprehensive test case to verify CI behavior with invalid API keys

### Runtime Error Fixes

**Interface Mismatch in heart.ts**:
- **Error**: `TypeError: params.locateTarget is not a function` at runtime
- **Root Cause**: Function parameter interface used `targetStrategy` but code called `params.locateTarget`
- **Fix**: Updated interface to match deliberate naming change:
  ```typescript
  // Updated parameter interface
  locateTarget: Targeting  // was: targetStrategy: Targeting
  
  // Updated function call in retrieveMarkdown
  locateTarget: (locale, sourcePath) => { ... }  // was: targetStrategy
  ```
- **Impact**: Fixed complete l10n pipeline runtime failure

**Dry-run Statistics Terminology**:
- Updated `Stats` interface: `filesToLocalize` → `l10nsToCapture` 
- Updated all console output to use consistent l10n terminology
- Changed final message: "no l10ns were captured" vs "no l10ns were performed"

### Testing & Validation

**Test Suite Fixes**:
- All branch safety tests passing with updated function/variable names
- All mode tests passing with corrected expectations
- Added critical CI API key safety test case
- Fixed test cleanup to use proper environment variable names

**End-to-End Script Testing**:
- **First actual script run**: `pnpm l10n:dry-run` revealed real runtime errors
- Successfully completed dry-run after fixes: 160 cached files, 0 new l10ns needed
- Validated endangered l10n protection with `pnpm clean`
- Confirmed all test scripts working: `test-branch-safety.ts`, `test-mode.ts`

## Critical Discovery: Git Tracking Issues

### Problem Identified
During script testing, discovered git warnings indicating serious branch setup problems:
```
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
git pull <remote> <branch>
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> l10-preview
```

### Root Cause Analysis
**The Problem**: `setupBranchAndTracking()` function has flawed logic:
1. Creates new branch locally (e.g., `l10-preview`)
2. Tries to set upstream to `origin/l10-preview` 
3. **But remote branch doesn't exist yet!**
4. Silently ignores the failure and claims success
5. Leaves branch in broken state for git operations

**Current Broken Logic**:
```typescript
try {
    execSync(`git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/${branch} ${branch}`)
    console.log(`✓ Set up tracking for ${branch}`)
} catch (e) {
    // PROBLEM: Silent failure masking
    console.log('ℹ️ Tracking already set up or remote branch not available')
}
```

### Solution Design
**Workflow Separation**:
- **Existing Remote Branch**: Set up tracking immediately 
- **New Branch**: Create locally, defer upstream setup until first push with `-u`
- **Honest Error Reporting**: No more silent failures with fake success messages

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Check if `origin/branch` exists before setting upstream
- Use `git push -u origin branch` for first push to set upstream
- Provide clear user communication about branch state
- Handle pull/push operations appropriately based on upstream status

### Testing Strategy Designed
- Unit tests with mocked git commands for different scenarios
- Integration tests with real git repos in controlled states
- End-to-end workflow testing (new branch → work → push)
- Error injection for network/permission failures

## Documentation Updates

**L10N_BRANCH_SAFETY_PLAN_v2.md**:
- Added comprehensive section on git tracking issues
- Documented solution design and testing strategy
- Updated completion status for all major work items

**CLAUDE.md**:
- Added "Current Investigation Status" section with progress summary
- Clear next priorities for successor Claude instances
- Instruction to read branch safety plan for complete context

**Process Improvement Note**:
- This session demonstrated critical value of testing actual scripts vs just unit tests
- Found real runtime errors that would have caused production failures
- "Expected warnings" are a process smell - all warnings should be investigated

## Next Session Priorities

1. **CRITICAL**: Implement git tracking fixes in branch safety system
2. **VALIDATION**: Test complete l10n workflow end-to-end with all scenarios
3. **CONTINUATION**: Return to investigating en-prefix/500 error issues  
4. **DEPLOYMENT**: Deploy completed l10n infrastructure to production

## Files Modified

**Core l10n files**: `mode.ts`, `heart.ts`, `git-ops.ts`, `run.ts`, `force.ts`
**Test files**: `test-branch-safety.ts`, `test-mode.ts`
**Config files**: `clean.ts`, `inlang-settings.ts`, `src/lib/l10n.ts`
**Documentation**: `L10N_BRANCH_SAFETY_PLAN_v2.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

## Key Metrics

- **Tests**: 9/9 test cases passing across all test suites
- **Scripts**: Successfully ran first end-to-end l10n dry-run  
- **Security**: Fixed critical CI API key validation issue
- **Consistency**: Completed comprehensive terminology migration
- **Discovery**: Identified and designed solution for git tracking problems

**Overall Status**: Branch safety infrastructure is functionally complete with one critical git issue to resolve before production deployment.
