# Session Summary: Write Tool Improvements

**Date**: 2025-07-16
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Participants**: Anthony, Claude

## Objective
Continue improving the write tool's infrastructure, focusing on state management, UX refinements, and testing workflow behavior.

## Key Decisions & Changes

### 1. Debug Export Functionality
- **Added**: Server endpoint `/api/debug-export` that writes browser state to multiple files in `logs/`
- **Added**: Blue "Export Debug State" button that shows timestamp on success (no more alert dialogs)
- **Feature**: Auto-export on every stage action for easier debugging
- **Result**: Claude can now see browser state by reading exported files

### 2. Client-Side Duration Tracking Fix
- **Issue**: Server state didn't include `durationSec`, causing Stage 2 not to appear after reload
- **Solution**: Update `currentStateToken` with client-enhanced `timedRounds` after adding durations
- **Result**: Progress dialog and stage progression now persist correctly across reloads

### 3. Progress Dialog Improvements
- **Issue**: Progress dialog showed loading animation even when complete
- **Solution**: 
  - Separated `.progress` and `.progress.inflight` CSS classes
  - Animation only shows when `inflight` is true
  - Removed `showProgress` variable - dialog shows whenever `timedRounds` has data
- **Renamed**: `loading` â†’ `inflight` throughout for clarity

### 4. UX State Refactoring
- **Issue**: Duplicate state with individual variables and reactive `ux` object
- **Solution**: Migrated to single `ux` object as source of truth
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cleaner code
  - Proper state restoration on reload
  - Contact selection now persists

### 5. File Watching Issue
- **Problem**: HMR completely broken - required server restart for changes
- **Cause**: Running with `pnpm dev | tee` broke TTY detection
- **Solution**: Use `script -f logs/dev.log -c "pnpm dev"` instead
- **Also fixed**: Increased inotify limit to 524288

## Technical Details

### State Architecture
- Single `ux` object replaces individual variables
- Simple restoration: `if (storage.ux) { ux = storage.ux }`
- Contact selection saves on click via `saveToStorage()`

### CSS Architecture
```css
.progress { /* Base styling */ }
.progress.inflight { /* Gradient animation */ }
@keyframes inflight { /* Animation definition */ }
```

### Legacy Code Identified
- `contacts_inputs` array (Stage 1 complete)
- `askDetails_inputs` vs `ask_inputs` confusion
- `currentStateToken` misleading name
- Dead CSS class `.loading`
- Various double-prefixed variables from sed

## Testing Results
- Stage 1 caching works with workflow ID "msps" and "eh6"
- Progress dialog shows correctly (green when complete, animated when inflight)
- Contact selection persists across reloads
- 409 error displays correctly for mismatched prompts
- Empty search field fails silently (needs button disable)

## Current Status
- Stage 1 fully migrated to info architecture
- All major state management issues resolved
- Ready to migrate Stages 2-5 to info architecture

## Next Steps
1. Disable Stage 1 button when search field is empty
2. Migrate Stage 2 (chooseContact) to info architecture
3. Continue migration for remaining stages
4. Consider renaming `currentStateToken` for clarity
