# Merging Main into Paraglide Branch (April 20, 2025)

## Summary
Successfully merged the main branch into the paraglide branch, which is maintained in `notes/references/website-prototype/`. This merge brings all recent content updates and feature additions from the main PauseAI website into our localization prototype branch.

## Key Changes Merged

- Added `/write` feature with Anthropic API integration
- Updated content for several posts including protests, vacancies, and action pages 
- Incorporated collaboration guidance ("Squash and merge" recommendation)
- Updated dependencies to newer versions
- Integrated fallback data handling for AirTable in development

## Conflict Resolution

We resolved several merge conflicts:

1. **README.md**: Kept paraglide branch content about localization while adding the "Squash and merge" guidance from main
2. **package.json**: Maintained localization-specific type dependencies while updating Node version
3. **template.env**: Combined environment settings, adding ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FOR_WRITE while preserving PARAGLIDE_LOCALES
4. **src/posts/protests.md**: Updated to use the current events link pattern
5. **pnpm-lock.yaml**: Regenerated completely to avoid manual resolution

## Validation

The development server was successfully started and verified working after merge completion. This brings the paraglide branch up to date with all main branch changes since the previous merge on March 20, 2025.
