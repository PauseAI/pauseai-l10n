# Environment Detection Refactor (April 21, 2025)

## Summary
We refactored how environment variables are detected and used throughout the codebase, particularly focusing on NODE_ENV and how it's used to determine if we're in a development environment.

## Key Changes

1. **Environment Helpers**
   - Created centralized environment utilities in `src/lib/env.ts`
   - Added `getEnvironment()` to handle both Node.js and browser contexts
   - Implemented `isDev()` with consistent rules (undefined defaults to dev)
   - Added `getDevContext()` for rich environment logging

2. **Simplified Interface**
   - Removed redundant environment parameters from helper functions
   - Made all functions automatically determine current environment
   - Made functions more explicit about environment detection logic
   - Fixed locale override detection for consistent behavior

3. **npm Scripts Improvements**
   - Restructured package.json scripts for consistent environment handling
   - Created explicit development and production script paths
   - Ensured NODE_ENV propagation through all command chains
   - Fixed preview script that was referencing a non-existent command

4. **Improved Logging**
   - Added comprehensive environment logging in multiple places
   - Made environment context logging show all relevant variables
   - Simplified debug output to be more direct and informative

## Future Work

1. Implement dry-run mode for translations in development to:
   - Skip actual translation API calls in development
   - Skip inactive locales during build
   - Use caching for existing translations

2. Test the environment detection thoroughly
   - Verify behavior in different modes (dev, production, undefined)
   - Check environment inheritance across script chains

These changes prepare the codebase for better optimization of the build process by creating a solid foundation for environment-aware operations.
