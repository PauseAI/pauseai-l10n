  # Merging Main Branch into Paraglide Branch

  ## Summary

  We successfully merged the latest changes from the main branch into our paraglide localization branch, integrating new features while preserving
  all localization functionality. This merge brings the paraglide branch up-to-date with the latest production code, making it ready for eventual
  integration back into the main branch.

  ## Key Changes

  1. **Feature Integration**
     - Added NearbyEvent component from main branch
     - Incorporated the new /write feature with Anthropic API integration
     - Integrated ProgressBar and other UI improvements

  2. **Conflict Resolution**
     - Resolved conflicts in layout files preserving both paraglide's localization and main's UI improvements
     - Preserved paraglide's message-based localization in the Home component
     - Integrated environment variable configurations from both branches
     - Fixed locale detection with URL pattern handling

  3. **Improvements and Fixes**
     - Fixed locale persistence by reordering strategy priorities (cookie > URL > preferredLanguage > baseLocale)
     - Improved URL handling with deLocalizeHref throughout the layout component
     - Fixed Airtable API calls in development mode with more robust environment detection
     - Fixed translation early return when only "en" locale is configured
     - Enhanced URL pattern handling to maintain locale selection

  ## Testing

  We conducted comprehensive testing of:
  - Airtable functionality with and without API keys
  - Locale switching and URL patterns across different pages
  - Layout components in different locales
  - TOC component visibility based on content type
  - Environment variable overrides
  - New features from main branch
  - Build process in both development and production modes

  ## Next Steps

  1. The paraglide branch is now ready to be merged back into main
  2. We can use PARAGLIDE_LOCALES=en in CI/CD to prevent exposing translations until ready
  3. We should implement branch-specific translation repository usage to avoid translations from PR previews contaminating production
  4. Continue improvements to locale switcher behavior on error pages
