# Localization URL Patterns Implementation

## Current Status
- ✅ Modified `l10n.ts` to implement explicit URL patterns for all locales
- ✅ Fixed the "prefix-all-locales" strategy to properly include the base locale (English)
- ✅ Updated sitemap files to correctly include locale prefixes in URLs
- ✅ Prepared website for consistent URL structure across all languages

## Technical Changes

### URL Pattern Generation
- Modified `writeSettingsFile()` to dynamically generate URL patterns based on active locales
- Added code to explicitly set patterns for all languages, including English
- Pattern format: `:protocol://:domain(.*)::port?/${locale}/:path(.*)?`
- Ensured the generated patterns are included in the compiled settings.json

### Consistent Path Structure
- Changed Paraglide URL behavior to use consistent format: `/{locale}/{path}`
- Base locale (English) now follows same URL structure as other languages
- This creates a more predictable routing experience for users and tools

### Benefits
- Improved SEO with consistent URL structure
- Better predictability for routing and navigation
- Simplified debugging by eliminating special case handling for base locale
- Easier to add additional locales in the future

## How It Works
The implementation injects custom URL patterns into Paraglide's configuration when the settings.json file is generated. These patterns explicitly define how URLs should be constructed for each supported locale, ensuring all languages follow the same pattern.

The default Paraglide implementation had a hardcoded special case that treated the base locale differently, not adding the locale prefix to its URLs. Our modification overrides this behavior by providing explicit patterns for all locales, including the base locale.

## Next Steps
- Test locale switching throughout the site to ensure consistent behavior
- Update server-side redirects to handle paths without locale prefixes
- Consider implementing a more comprehensive sitemap.xml generator that includes all language variants
- Document the URL structure for future developers
