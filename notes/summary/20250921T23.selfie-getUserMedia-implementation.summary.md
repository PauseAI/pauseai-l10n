# Session Summary: getUserMedia Selfie Implementation
**Date**: 2024-10-21 16:00 UTC
**Repository**: pauseai-website (feature/selfie-upload branch)
**Focus**: Implementing direct camera access for selfie capture

## Context
Following previous work on Cloudinary REST API migration (see 20240911T20.cloudinary-edge-migration.summary.md), this session focused on improving the selfie upload experience by implementing direct camera access via getUserMedia API.

## Problem Statement
Users were confused by the mobile experience where accessing the camera required clicking through "My Files" in the Cloudinary widget. This was standard mobile browser behavior but unintuitive, especially compared to native apps or video calling experiences.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. getUserMedia Camera Integration
- Added live video preview using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`
- Front-facing camera (`facingMode: 'user'`) for selfies
- Direct capture to canvas, then upload to Cloudinary
- Fallback to Cloudinary widget when camera unavailable

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- **Statement-first design**: User sees what they're supporting before taking photo
- **Speech bubble**: Statement displayed in visually distinct bubble with tail
- **Unified widget**: Camera preview and gallery upload in same container
- **Large touch targets**: Full-width buttons optimized for mobile
- **"or" divider**: Clear visual separation between options
- **No duplicate titles**: Removed redundant headings

### 3. Technical Features
- **Unique public_id generation**: `selfie_${timestamp}_${randomStr}`
- **Camera shutter sound**: Two-click audio feedback on capture
- **Stream persistence**: Camera stays active for retakes
- **HTTPS detection**: Only attempts camera on secure contexts
- **Proper aspect ratio**: Video preview shows full frame (no cropping)

## Key Code Components

### Camera Initialization
```javascript
stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    facingMode: 'user',
    width: { ideal: 640 },
    height: { ideal: 480 }
  },
  audio: false
})
```

### Capture Process
1. Check video dimensions
2. Draw to canvas (mirrored)
3. Convert to blob
4. Play shutter sound
5. Upload to Cloudinary with unique ID

### CSS Fixes
- Changed `object-fit: cover` to `contain` (shows full frame)
- Removed forced `aspect-ratio: 4/3` (let video determine)
- Removed unused `.statement-upload-card` styles

## Testing Results

### Localhost (HTTPS)
✅ Camera permission requested and granted
✅ Live preview displays correctly
✅ Capture and upload work
✅ Email collection functional

### Network IP (HTTP)
❌ No camera access (requires HTTPS except localhost)
✅ Cloudinary widget fallback works

### Mobile Devices
- Camera access requires HTTPS
- When available, provides better UX than widget
- Fallback maintains functionality

## Code Quality
- Fixed all TypeScript errors
- Removed unused variables (`cameraError`)
- Fixed `any` types (webkitAudioContext)
- Passes `pnpm check` and `pnpm lint`
- Added reminder to CLAUDE.md about running checks

## Challenges Encountered

### ngrok Rate Limits
Attempted to use ngrok for HTTPS testing but hit rate limits with development server's many JS modules. Switched to Netlify preview deployments.

### Video Display Issues
Initial black video was due to missing `play()` call. Fixed with explicit play and Svelte action for stream connection.

### Sound Design
Initial oscillator-based sound was "warmer boink" than expected. Redesigned with two square wave clicks for more realistic shutter sound.

## Next Session Requirements

### Remaining UX Refinements
Based on team discussion, need to address:

1. **Selfie tips/instructions** (Tom's list):
   - Best camera available
   - Well-lit area
   - Avoid distracting backgrounds
   - Center face
   - Hold camera level or above
   - Arms-length distance

2. **Petition text refinement**:
   - Current: Long statement about AI risks
   - Proposed: "We say no to the race to build superintelligent AI"
   - Keep minimal for conversion
   - Context in subtitle/below

3. **User flow optimization**:
   - Simple path: read → understand → snap → email
   - Make email entry feel natural/valuable
   - Consider showing value proposition for email

4. **Polish items**:
   - Email duplicate handling (defer to backend)
   - Better loading states
   - Success feedback improvements
   - Mobile-specific adjustments

## Technical Debt
- Stream management could be more robust
- Audio context should be properly cleaned up
- Consider lazy-loading Cloudinary widget script

## Files Modified
- `/src/routes/selfie/+page.svelte` - Main implementation
- `/src/lib/cloudinary.ts` - (Previously modified for REST API)
- `/scripts/exclude-from-edge-function.ts` - (Previously modified)
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added code quality check reminder
- `/vite.config.ts` - Attempted ngrok configuration (reverted)

## Current Status
Feature is functionally complete but needs UX refinements before production. Core getUserMedia implementation working well, providing significant improvement over widget-only approach for supported devices.

## For Next Session
New session should focus on:
1. Implementing selfie tips/instructions UI
2. Refining petition text to team's final decision  
3. Optimizing the email collection experience
4. Final polish for production readiness

Consider creating a more detailed onboarding flow that guides users through the optimal photo-taking process while maintaining simplicity.
