# Preparing for Discussion with Joep - Technical Summary

## Key Decisions & Outcomes

1. Build Process Safety
   - Added checks for translation cache before build
   - Moved validation from server hooks to Vite plugin
   - Added safeguards against accidental LLM API calls
   - Improved error messages for missing translations

2. Project Structure
   - Confirmed mainline site uses SvelteKit with Netlify adapter
   - Identified key integration points for localization
   - Mapped out build-time vs runtime needs
   - Located critical files for modification

3. Prototype Analysis
   - Examined Paraglide integration (v1.11.3)
   - Found translation script structure
   - Identified build process improvements needed
   - Noted Airtable dependency issues

4. Search Integration
   - Identified Pagefind as search solution
   - Noted requirements for localized search:
     - Index translated content
     - UI string translation
     - Language-specific results

## Implementation Status

1. Completed
   - Basic project structure
   - Initial build process
   - Translation cache validation
   - Development environment setup

2. In Progress
   - Build process refinements
   - Error handling improvements
   - Translation workflow safety
   - Local development setup

3. Known Issues
   - Airtable integration needs configuration
   - Some pages fail during static build
   - Translation cache structure needs refinement

## Next Steps

1. Technical Tasks
   - Complete build process safety measures
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Set up monitoring for LLM usage
   - Refine translation cache structure

2. Integration Work
   - Finalize Pagefind integration
   - Complete Paraglide setup
   - Resolve Airtable configuration
   - Improve build process reliability

## Open Questions
- Optimal handling of dynamic content
- Best practices for cache management
- Production deployment safeguards
- Cost monitoring approach
