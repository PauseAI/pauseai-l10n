# Git Consolidation and Security Fixes - April 26, 2025

## Summary
In this session, we focused on preparing the paraglide branch for merging back to main by consolidating numerous incremental commits and addressing security concerns:

1. Consolidated 32 small commits into a single cohesive commit
2. Fixed environment variable handling in preview builds
3. Added security measures to prevent GitHub token exposure

## Git History Consolidation
- Developed a systematic approach to organize 32 incremental commits into a single logical unit
- Created a well-structured commit message organized by functional areas:
  1. Paraglide 2.0 Integration & Core Environment Setup
  2. Language Switcher & User Experience Improvements
  3. Build Process Optimization
  4. CMS Integration and Localization Support
- Added commands in the commit message to help developers examine specific file changes for each area

## Environment Handling Improvements
- Uncovered an issue with environment variables not being properly loaded in preview mode
- Removed mode-based guard around `dotenv.config()` in vite.config.ts
- Added debugging to understand the environment context in different build scenarios
- Maintained compatibility with SvelteKit conventions where preview still has DEV=true

## Security Enhancement
- Addressed Netlify security warning about GitHub tokens in build artifacts
- Identified that the token was left in the git cache file after build completion
- Implemented a targeted cleanup of Git credentials in production builds only
- Used a minimalist approach with an empty catch block for a clean implementation

## Key Technical Decisions
- Chose to follow SvelteKit's environment detection convention over Vite's for consistency
- Demonstrated that `NODE_ENV=production pnpm preview` can be used for true production-like testing
- Added token cleanup only in production builds to maintain developer convenience
- Used a fallback approach for robust environment detection across client & server contexts

The paraglide branch is now ready for merging, with a clean history, robust environment handling, and proper security measures in place.
