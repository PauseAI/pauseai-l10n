# Build Process Improvements - April 24, 2025

## Summary
In this session, we improved the build and translation processes for the PauseAI website prototype:

1. Fixed environment variable propagation through the Vite dev server
2. Reduced log verbosity for build and translation processes
3. Optimized Git operations to avoid unnecessary authentication

## Environment Variable Propagation
- Identified that Vite restarts on `.env` changes but doesn't always propagate changes to runtime
- Added `dotenv.config({ override: true })` in development mode to ensure environment variable updates are recognized
- This allows environment changes like `PARAGLIDE_LOCALES` to take effect without manual server restart

## Build Log Improvements
- Created a filter script `filter-build-log.js` that:
  - Captures and suppresses individual chunk output lines
  - Categorizes chunks as client or server based on path
  - Provides a concise summary of total chunks and size
- Improved SvelteKit a11y warnings by configuring `onwarn` in svelte.config.js
- Updated package.json to use the filtered build as the default for development

## Translation Process Optimization
- Reduced verbosity of translation logs when using cached translations:
  - Eliminated individual "Using cached translation" messages
  - Added summary counters showing cache usage statistics
- Added intelligence to Git operations:
  - Added counters to track total files and new translations
  - Skip Git push entirely when all translations are from cache
  - Only attempt to push when there are actual changes

## Key Technical Solutions
- Used `defineConfig` in Vite for more explicit environment management
- Implemented targeted text processing with Node.js to filter build logs
- Updated the translation process to track and report more useful statistics
- Applied conditional Git operations based on actual content changes
