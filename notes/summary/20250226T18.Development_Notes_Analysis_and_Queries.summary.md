# Chat Session Summary - Vite Chunk Loading Investigation

## Context
- Investigating language-specific chunk loading issues in Vite preview mode
- Server correctly serves German content but hydration picks wrong chunks

## Investigation Path
1. Identified chunk structure:
   - Server chunks: `faq.js`, `faq2.js`, `faq3.js` (ordered by language)
   - Client chunks: `faq.CQToAYjs.js`, etc. (hash-based naming)

2. Key Findings:
   - Server uses numeric suffixes for language association
   - Client uses hash-based naming that loses language order
   - Issue occurs during hydration phase

## Status
- Problem diagnosed and likely fixed in GitHub issue
- Root cause: Language association lost during chunk resolution in preview mode

## Implementation Details
- Server chunks in `.svelte-kit/output/server/chunks/`
- Client chunks in `build/_app/immutable/chunks/`
- Chunk resolution handled by Vite's preview server code

## Next Steps
- Monitor GitHub issue for resolution confirmation
- No further investigation needed
