# Session Summary: Template.env Fix and Pull Request Creation

**Date**: December 12, 2025  
**Duration**: Continued from previous session (context compacted)  
**Branch**: `link-localization-and-postbuild-infrastructure` â†’ `main`

## Primary Accomplishments

### 1. Template.env Fix Applied to Main
- **Problem**: Missing `AIRTABLE_WRITE_API_KEY` in template.env was causing build failures
- **Root Cause**: Static import in `/api/verify/+server.ts` required the environment variable to be defined
- **Solution**: Added empty default to template.env following pattern of other optional API keys
- **Action**: Committed and pushed fix directly to main branch (approved by user)

### 2. Feature Branch Build Testing
- **Target**: `link-localization-and-postbuild-infrastructure` branch
- **Scope**: Testing builds with l10n infrastructure and postbuild scripts
- **Result**: Build:dev works correctly with template.env copy, filtered logging functional
- **Purpose Clarified**: build:dev serves filtered logging and development context, not avoiding env requirements

### 3. Pull Request Creation
- **Commits Squashed**: 4 commits consolidated into single comprehensive commit
- **PR #365 Created**: "Link localization and postbuild infrastructure" 
- **Content**: Link localization via custom `a.svelte` component + postbuild script infrastructure
- **Status**: PR for visibility, ready to merge pending build/preview verification

### 4. Git Branch Management
- **Issue**: `paraglide-archive` branch had no tracking relationship with remote
- **Symptoms**: "Everything up-to-date" on push, "no tracking information" on pull
- **Resolution**: Set upstream tracking with `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/paraglide-archive`
- **Verification**: Confirmed commit history preservation for main branch changelog references

## Technical Details

### Environment Variable Handling
- **Static vs Dynamic**: `/api/verify` uses static imports (build-time), `/api/write` uses dynamic (runtime)
- **Dev vs Prod**: isDev() checks multiple conditions (NODE_ENV, env.DEV flag)
- **Build Requirements**: Production builds require all static env vars to be defined (even if empty)

### Build Process Understanding
- **build:dev**: Provides filtered logging and development context markers
- **build**: Full production build with l10n steps and postbuild scripts
- **Filter Function**: Suppresses verbose output while preserving important messages

### PR Strategy
- **Visibility Focus**: PR created primarily for team awareness, not blocking review
- **Squash Approach**: Multiple incremental commits consolidated for clean history
- **Direct Merge Plan**: Will merge to main once build/preview validation passes

## Files Modified
- `template.env` (main branch): Added `AIRTABLE_WRITE_API_KEY = ""`
- Squashed commit encompasses link localization and postbuild infrastructure changes

## Next Steps
1. Monitor PR #365 build/preview status
2. Merge to main when validation completes
3. Historical commit references now properly preserved via paraglide-archive tracking

## Key Learnings
- Template.env must include all statically imported environment variables
- Build:dev serves specific development purposes beyond environment avoidance
- Git branch tracking relationships require explicit setup after remote push
- PR creation provides visibility while maintaining direct merge capability
