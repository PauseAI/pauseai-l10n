# Session Summary: Selfie Upload Feature Refactoring
**Date:** 2025-09-22T14:00
**Branch:** feature/selfie-upload
**Commit:** abd72c7

## Objective
Fix layout order issue where selfie capture UX appeared below the header instead of above it, and refactor the component architecture for better maintainability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Layout Architecture - Prelude Pattern
- **Problem:** Capture UX was appearing after header (Header â†’ Capture â†’ Content â†’ Footer)
- **Solution:** Implemented "prelude" pattern in main layout
- **Result:** Correct order achieved (Capture â†’ Header â†’ Content â†’ Footer)
- **Implementation:** Dynamic component import in `/src/routes/+layout.svelte` checking for `/selfie` route

### 2. Component Refactoring
- **Created:** `selfieStore.ts` - Centralized state management for all selfie-related logic
- **Created:** `SelfieUX.svelte` - Extracted UI component from main page
- **Modified:** `+page.svelte` - Simplified to just initialization and page content
- **Result:** Clean separation of concerns between UI, state, and page structure

### 3. Camera Permission Flow
- **Issue:** Browser was prompting for camera permission immediately on page load
- **Fix:** Check permission status without prompting, only auto-initialize if already granted
- **Denial Handling:** Show disabled "Camera Blocked - Reload!" button to guide manual page refresh

### 4. UX Improvements
- Book title centered horizontally
- Statement changed to first person: "I demand we end the race to build superintelligent AI"
- Added subtitle: "Upload your selfie to say:"
- Camera box changed from 4:3 landscape to 3:4 portrait (200px wide)
- All colors made theme-aware using CSS variables
- Secondary button hover state fixed (was showing unreadable text)

### 5. Email Collection Copy
- Simplified to inline "Please add:" label with placeholder "your@email.com"
- Updated text: "We won't share this, but it helps us show real people supported, and we'll tell you once you're in a collage!"
- Emphasis on both verification and notification benefits

### 6. Page Content Updates
- Removed outdated "launches September 16" reference
- Reordered content flow: book description â†’ link â†’ visual petition explanation
- Removed unused CSS styles after component extraction

## Technical Details

### Store Pattern
The `selfieStore.ts` exports:
- Writable stores for all state (currentState, uploadedImage, etc.)
- Module-level variables for DOM elements and widget instances
- Setter functions for elements that need binding
- All camera/capture/submission logic

### Permission Handling
```typescript
// Check permission without prompting
const permission = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'camera' })
if (permission.state === 'granted') {
    // Only auto-initialize if definitely granted
    await initializeCamera()
}
```

### Files Modified
- `/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Added prelude pattern
- `/src/routes/selfie/+page.svelte` - Simplified, removed duplicate CSS
- `/src/routes/selfie/+page.ts` - Empty load function (new)
- `/src/routes/selfie/SelfieUX.svelte` - Main UI component (new)
- `/src/routes/selfie/selfieStore.ts` - State management (new)

## Testing Status
- âœ… TypeScript checks pass (`pnpm check`)
- âœ… Linting passes (`pnpm lint`)
- âœ… Local development working
- âœ… Committed and pushed to `feature/selfie-upload`
- âœ… Tested on Android - working well
- ðŸ”„ Ready for London book reading event tonight

## Additional Improvements (Post-testing)
### Commit 48f673d - Mobile UX & Cloudinary Deletion
- Fixed text wrapping on narrow screens by removing hardcoded line breaks
- Reduced mobile title font from 1.5rem to 1.4rem
- Left-aligned email label on mobile when it wraps
- **Added Cloudinary deletion** when removing photos (was only clearing local state)

### Commit 48f7f82 - Selfie Tips
- Further reduced mobile title font to 1.3rem (still wrapping on very narrow phones)
- **Added expandable selfie tips** after photo preview with:
  - Tom's guidelines in condensed form with emojis
  - Smooth slide-down animation
  - Suggestion to retry if unhappy with photo
- Tips appear at the right moment - after upload when users can judge their photo

## Production Readiness
Feature is ready for the London book reading event tonight. Users can visit `pauseai.info/selfie` to upload selfies. Images go to `test_prototype` folder in free Cloudinary account (temporary solution).

## Next Steps
1. Monitor usage during London event
2. Create PR to merge into main after event testing
3. Still needed for full campaign:
   - Backend approval interface for campaign runners
   - Collage generation tooling
   - Production Cloudinary setup
