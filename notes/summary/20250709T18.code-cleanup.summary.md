# Code Cleanup Session Summary - 2025-01-09

## Session Context
Continued work on PauseAI write tool after restructuring introduced bugs. Focus on cleaning up terminology inconsistencies and fixing message handling issues identified in previous session.

## Key Problems Addressed

### 1. Message Indexing Bug
**Issue**: UI used `roundIndex * 2 + 1` to access messages, but `roundIndex` doesn't correspond to message pairs due to async round queuing.

**Solution**: Count completed rounds before current round to calculate correct message index:
```javascript
const completedRoundsBeforeThis = timedRounds
  .slice(0, roundIndex)
  .filter(r => r.durationSec !== undefined)
  .length
const messageIndex = completedRoundsBeforeThis * 2 + 1
```

### 2. Terminology Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Mixed use of "step/round", "target/contact", "message/ask" caused confusion.

**Solution**: Systematic terminology cleanup:
- **Stages**: User decision points (discoverContacts, chooseContact, defineAsk, writeEmail, reviseEmail)
- **Rounds**: Server processing (discover, research, address, define, draft, trim, flow, tone, polish, revise)
- **Contacts**: People being reached out to (not "targets")
- **Ask**: User's request content (not "message" which conflicts with LLM dialogue)

### 3. Naming Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Prompt keys used underscores, CSS/IDs mixed old terminology.

**Solution**: Consistent camelCase naming throughout:
- System prompts: `'First_Draft'` → `'Draft'`
- CSS/IDs: `target-search` → `contact-search`
- Variables: `selectedTargetIndex` → `selectedContactIndex`

## Technical Improvements

### Backend Changes
- Updated stage progression from numeric (1-5) to named stages
- Simplified round handlers with consistent prompt naming
- Fixed system prompt references to match new terminology
- Cleaned up comments and removed unnecessary complexity

### Frontend Changes
- Fixed reactive parsing to use new stage names
- Updated all CSS classes and IDs for consistency
- Renamed variables and functions throughout
- Fixed UI labels to use warmer "contact" language

## Architecture Insights

### Stage vs Round Distinction
**Anthony's insight**: Stages naturally group differently for user activities vs server processing. This distinction helps clarify when users need to make decisions vs when the system is working.

### Flexible Stage Design
**Anthony's observation**: Some stages have deliberate flexibility (ask definition can be standardized for campaigns or target-dependent for custom outreach). The architecture should support both patterns.

### Message vs Ask Terminology
**Anthony's insight**: Critical to distinguish between LLM dialogue messages and the persuasive content being crafted. This prevents ambiguity in code and communication.

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ Fixed message indexing bug
- ✅ Implemented consistent naming scheme
- ✅ Updated all prompt keys and system references
- ✅ Cleaned up frontend terminology
- ✅ Fixed CSS/ID naming inconsistencies

### Known Issues for Future
- Progress display may still show duplicates
- Form auto-population edge cases
- Some complexity remains from old tab-based system
- Error handling could be more robust

## Development Process Notes

### Effective Patterns
- **Systematic renaming**: Working through backend first, then frontend
- **Consistent application**: Using search/replace for thoroughness
- **Clear documentation**: Tracking changes for future reference

### Areas for Improvement
- **Testing**: Many changes made without runtime testing
- **Context management**: Large refactoring strains token limits
- **Incremental validation**: Need more frequent testing of changes

## Future Considerations

### Multi-Contact Workflow
Anthony envisions users potentially reusing Stage 1 to select multiple contacts for similar asks. Current architecture should support this pattern.

### Research Integration
Future enhancement could inform contact search with eventual ask content, enabling more targeted contact discovery.

### Terminology Evolution
The "target" → "contact" change reflects broader consideration of respectful language in AI-assisted outreach tools.
