# Technical Summary: Merging Updates from Main Branch

## Context
- Merged 100 commits from origin/main into the paraglide branch
- Resolved conflicts in lock files and code files

## Decisions and Outcomes

### Lock File Conflicts
- Successfully resolved conflicts in `deno.lock` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Maintained dependency integrity by preserving both branches' dependencies
- Kept newer versions where version conflicts existed (e.g., picocolors 1.1.1 over 1.1.0)

### Code Conflicts
- Resolved conflicts in several files:
  - `+layout.ts`: Combined i18n language detection with redirect handling
  - `[slug]/+page.ts`: Preserved language-aware markdown imports
  - `[slug]/+page.svelte`: Integrated reactive data handling with UI improvements

### Translation System
- Verified the translation system correctly identified and updated translations for modified content
- Confirmed the Git-based caching system is working as designed

### Repository Management
- Created a merge commit with message "Merge origin/main: Integrate i18n support with 100(!) mainline updates"
- Added an empty verification commit documenting successful build and translations
- Successfully pushed changes to the remote paraglide branch using SSH authentication

## Status
- Merge complete and verified
- All conflicts resolved
- Translations updated for modified content
- Changes pushed to remote repository

## Next Steps
- Continue development on the paraglide branch
- Let non-production preview build handle any remaining translations
- Consider optimizing the translation workflow to avoid duplicating work between local and remote cache
