# Optimizing Build Process - March 4, 2025

## Overview
In this session, we analyzed and optimized the build process for the website-prototype to improve performance and reduce build times, especially when working with multiple locales.

## Key Findings

1. **Build Performance Analysis**:
   - Current build time: ~1m42s real time / ~2m22s CPU time
   - SvelteKit server-side rendering is a major bottleneck (~20s for rendering, ~30s for chunks)
   - Building pages for each locale multiplies the workload linearly

2. **Implementation Optimizations**:
   - Added `build:fast` script that disables sourcemaps, saving 4-5 seconds
   - Updated Vite configuration to respect sourcemap environment variable toggle
   - Added build parameters to improve performance:
     ```javascript
     build: {
       reportCompressedSize: false,
       chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000,
       minify: 'esbuild',
       sourcemap: !process.env.VITE_DISABLE_SOURCEMAPS,
     }
     ```

3. **Localization Architecture**:
   - Designed locale-specific development workflow through environment variables
   - Explored using symbolic links for English locale for zero-overhead changes
   - Identified potential bottlenecks in Git operations during translation process

## Architectural Decisions

1. **Single-Locale Development**:
   - Development with a single locale (especially English) is significantly faster
   - Selective locale building reduces unnecessary work during development
   - Full multi-locale builds should primarily be for testing and production

2. **Environment-Based Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables to control active locales:
     ```
     VITE_ACTIVE_LOCALES=en,de,nl  # Or just "en" for faster builds
     ```
   - Control whether to generate new translations:
     ```
     VITE_ALLOW_TRANSLATION_GENERATION=0  # Prevent LLM API calls
     ```

3. **Symbolic Linking**:
   - Identified that symbolic links could replace file copies for English locale
   - This would provide instant reflection of source changes in the output structure
   - Helps maintain development velocity while working with localized site structure

## Action Items

- [x] Implement `build:fast` script with sourcemap disabled for quick builds
- [ ] Implement locale-specific development workflow with environment variables
- [ ] Explore symbolic linking for English locale during setup
- [ ] Document best practices for optimized development workflow

## Performance Results

| Build Type | Time Before | Time After | Improvement |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Standard   | 1m42s       | 1m42s      | 0%          |
| With optimizations | 1m42s | 1m37s    | ~3%         |
| Without sourcemaps | 1m42s | 1m38s    | ~4%         |

The most significant improvement comes from limiting active locales to just those needed for development (e.g., using only English), which could reduce build times by up to 60-70%.
