# Phase 2B: Collage Generation Web UI - Session Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12/13
**Branch:** main
**Status:** Phase 2B implementation complete, ready for testing/refinement

## Session Overview

Implemented Phase 2B: Complete collage generation system with web UI. Built library modules, CLI tool, FastAPI webapp, and Bootstrap templates. Successfully tested local collage generation with test_prototype campaign.

## What We Built

### 1. Core Library (`lib/`)

**`grid_optimizer.py`** - Layout calculation and scoring
- Ported from `tools/optimize_grid_v3.py`
- Functions: `get_top_layouts()`, `evaluate_custom_grid()`, `format_layout_description()`
- Returns top 3 layouts + supports custom grid validation
- Cost weights: OMIT_BASE_COST=1500, PAD_COST=1.0, CLIP_COST=2.0

**`collage_generator.py`** - End-to-end collage building
- `build_collage()` - Main orchestration function
- Tile selection (oldest first via mtime)
- Render generation (300×400 tiles → grid-specific dimensions)
- ImageMagick montage with transparent padding
- JPEG derivatives (cropped to actual collage size, white background)
- Manifest creation with metadata
- Email duplicate detection (warnings only, includes all tiles per #8)

**`workflow.py`** - High-level orchestration
- `get_layout_options()` - Get layouts for N images
- `validate_custom_layout()` - Check custom grid validity
- Bridge between CLI/webapp and core logic

### 2. CLI Tool (`tools/build_collage.py`)

Interactive collage builder:
- Usage: `./tools/build_collage.py test_prototype [n_images]`
- Defaults to all available tiles if n_images not specified
- Presents 3 recommended layouts + custom grid option
- Builds collage and reports file locations

### 3. Sync Tool (`tools/sync_tiles_from_ec2.py`)

Downloads tiles from EC2 to local dev environment:
- Usage: `./tools/sync_tiles_from_ec2.py test_prototype`
- Uses rsync over SSH
- Syncs tiles only (not sources or logs)
- Creates `/tmp/collagen-local/{campaign}/` structure

### 4. FastAPI Webapp (`webapp/main.py`)

**Route Structure** (simplified, no prefixes):
```
GET  /                          Dashboard (campaign list)
GET  /{campaign}                Campaign page with embedded build form
POST /{campaign}/new            Create new collage build
GET  /{campaign}/{build_id}     View completed build
GET  /{campaign}/{build_id}/{filename}  Serve images (4096.png, 4096.jpg, 1024.jpg)
```

**Key Features:**
- Campaign pages show stats, builds list, and embedded build form
- Layout options computed server-side, presented as radio buttons
- Custom grid option with text inputs
- Build triggers synchronous collage generation (30-60s)
- Redirect to build view page on completion

### 5. Templates (`webapp/templates/`)

**`base.html`** - Bootstrap 5 layout with nav
**`dashboard.html`** - Campaign cards with tile/build counts
**`campaign.html`** - Two-column: stats/build form (left), builds table (right)
**`build.html`** - Preview image, download links, metadata display

## Key Design Decisions

### Build ID Format
**Format:** `20251012T143022Z,20=5x4`
- UTC timestamp (ISO 8601: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
- Actual images used (from layout, not request)
- Grid dimensions (cols×rows)
- Comma separator (not hyphen, which looks like minus)

### Transparent Padding vs White Background
**PNG (4096.png):** Transparent padding (`-background none`)
**JPEGs (4096.jpg, 1024.jpg):** Cropped to actual collage dimensions, white background

### JPEG Derivatives
- Crop to actual collage size (e.g., 3840×4096 not 4096×4096)
- Preserve aspect ratio when scaling to 1024px
- White background fills transparent areas

### Route Structure
- No `/campaign/` prefix (campaigns are finite set: test_prototype, sayno)
- Build IDs always start with date (YYYYMMDD), avoiding conflicts
- Reserved word `/new` for build creation
- Filenames (4096.png) don't conflict with date-prefixed build IDs

## Testing Results

**Local collage build successful:**
```bash
./tools/sync_tiles_from_ec2.py test_prototype  # Downloaded 20 tiles
echo "1" | ./tools/build_collage.py test_prototype  # Built 5×4 collage
```

**Output:**
- Build: `20251012T061857,20=5x4`
- Files: 4096.png (12.9MB, transparent), 4096.jpg (2.2MB, 3840×4096), 1024.jpg (301KB, 960×1024)
- Build time: ~48 seconds
- Email duplicates detected: 3 addresses with 2 tiles each (logged, all included)

**Webapp tested:**
- Started: `python webapp/main.py` (port 8000)
- Dashboard loads successfully
- Campaign page loads with build form
- (Stopped before full flow test due to session wrap-up)

## Known Issues / TODOs

### Immediate (before production use):
1. **UX improvements needed** (identified at end of session):
   - Show score breakdown (omit/pad/clip components) for each layout option
   - Live preview for custom grid (show consequences before building)
   - Two-column layout: specs (left) vs selected consequences (right)

2. **Publishing workflow** (Phase 3):
   - Mark builds as "published" vs "draft"
   - Track which users have been emailed
   - Prevent duplicate emails
   - Email content design

3. **Email uniqueness handling** (Issue #8):
   - Currently warns but includes all tiles
   - Need decision: use all tiles or dedupe by email?

### Nice-to-have:
- Loading spinner during build (current: synchronous, blocks for 30-60s)
- Build cancellation
- Delete/archive old builds
- Adjust n_images without reloading page
- Thumbnail preview in builds table

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Finish UX improvements** (score breakdown, custom grid preview)
2. **Test full workflow** via webapp (build → view → download)
3. **Build real sayno collage** (238 tiles)
4. **Plan publishing workflow** (how to mark published, track email sends)
