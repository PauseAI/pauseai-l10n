# L10n Workflow Simplification Session
**Date**: 2025-06-01
**Branch**: l10-preview

## Summary

This session focused on simplifying the localization workflow by consolidating multiple flags and introducing branch-based safety mechanisms.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Terminology Standardization
- Renamed `audit-unlocalized-links.ts` to `l10ntamer.ts`
- Updated all package.json targets from `translate:*` to `l10n:*`
- Consistent use of "l10n" (localization) instead of "translate" throughout

### 2. Smart Postbuild Scripts
- Added configuration-based guards to postbuild scripts:
  - Edge function scripts check `USE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS` flag
  - l10ntamer checks if English routes are prefixed
- Scripts now skip gracefully with clear messages when not applicable

### 3. Routing Strategy Fix
- Fixed `inlang-settings.ts` to respect routing strategy from settings
- Only sets urlPatterns explicitly for `prefix-all-locales` strategy
- Lets Paraglide handle default `prefix` strategy behavior

### 4. Configuration Export
- Exported `USE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS` from svelte.config.js
- Enables postbuild scripts to detect deployment configuration

## Testing Results
- Confirmed l10ntamer correctly skips for `prefix` strategy
- Confirmed l10ntamer runs for `prefix-all-locales` strategy
- Verified edge function scripts skip when `USE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS=false`
- All postbuild guards working as expected

## Commit Created
- `c55769b`: "refactor: Improve postbuild scripts and localization terminology"
- Ready to apply to main branch after further testing

## Next Steps
- Implement environment variable changes for translation branch control
- Update translation scripts to use new l10n terminology
- Add branch-based safety to prevent writing to main from dev machines
- Test full workflow with new branch-based approach
- Update documentation
