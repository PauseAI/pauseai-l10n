# Technical Summary

## CMS Integration for Multilingual Support

### Overview
We adapted the Edit component to properly handle localization, providing different options for users viewing translated pages versus original English content. This ensures that content edits are directed to the appropriate source while translation improvements follow a structured feedback process.

### Key Changes

1. **Edit Component Modifications**
   - Added detection for translated pages using `languageTag()` from Paraglide runtime
   - Created different UI paths for original content vs. translations
   - For translated pages, provided two options:
     - Edit original English content (links to CMS or GitHub)
     - Suggest translation improvement (GitHub issue)

2. **Message Localization**
   - Added new localized messages following site naming conventions:
     - `footer_other_edit` - "Edit original English content"
     - `footer_other_l10n` - "Suggest translation improvement"
   - Added messages to source files to be processed by the translation system

3. **Translation Feedback Process**
   - Created a structured GitHub issue template for translation improvements
   - Template focuses on collecting actionable feedback for translation prompts
   - Included explanatory text about how translations are generated

### Implementation Details

- Used `languageTag()` instead of a non-existent `i18n.getLocale()` function
- Ensured all edit URLs point to the original English content in the CMS
- Simplified conditional rendering with `{:else if editUrl}` pattern
- Maintained consistent semicolon/style conventions with the codebase

### Status and Next Steps

- The implementation is complete and working for both English and translated pages
- Future work could include:
  - Tracking and incorporating translation feedback into the prompt system
  - Adding more specific guidance in the issue template based on feedback patterns
  - Potentially adding direct translation editing capabilities if needed
