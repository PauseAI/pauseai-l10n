# Paraglide Localization UX Improvements

## Environment Change Detection & Runtime Issues

### Identified Problem
- Environment variable changes (like `PARAGLIDE_LOCALES`) weren't properly detected after changes
- Conflicting runtime implementations caused issues with locale detection
- The paraglide-test directory was creating conflicts with the main paraglide runtime

### Solutions
1. **Environment Variable Detection**:
   - Created server-side API endpoint (`/api/locale-env/+server.ts`) to check current environment-calculated locales
   - Added client-side comparison in `+layout.ts` to compare server environment with runtime values
   - Implemented warning system using the Banner component to notify developers when mismatches occur

2. **Runtime Cleanup**:
   - Removed the conflicting `paraglide-test` directory which was causing runtime issues
   - Ensured consistent use of the main paraglide runtime throughout the application
   - Fixed import paths and references to use the correct runtime implementation

## Language Switcher Enhancements

### URL-Based Locale Detection
- Changed locale detection strategy to prioritize URL-based locale over cookies
- Updated configuration in both:
  - `vite.config.ts`: strategy order `['url', 'cookie', 'preferredLanguage', 'baseLocale']`
  - `project.inlang/default-settings.js`: matching configuration under languageNegotiation
  
This ensures consistency between build-time and runtime strategies and ensures localized URLs display the correct language.

### Language Switcher UI Improvements
- **Dual Language Display**:
  - Enhanced language names to show both current locale and native names
  - Implemented `getDualLanguageName()` function for intelligent name combination
  - Added lazy-loading pattern for language name formatters

- **AUTO Mode**:
  - Added "AUTO" option in language switcher to reset locale preference
  - Improved cookie clearing mechanism to reliably remove locale preferences
  - Added proper URL handling with Paraglide's deLocalizeHref

- **Attention-Grabbing Animation**:
  - Added CSS animation for language switcher (currently disabled)
  - Implemented pulse effect with color, shadow, and scaling transitions
  - Created special handling for dark backgrounds (inverted headers)
  - Added CSS variables for brand colors in RGB format

### Reliable Locale Switching
- Fixed setLocale behavior to ensure proper page reloading
- Added explicit reload parameter to handle SvelteKit client-side navigation
- Implemented fallback forced navigation for edge cases
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging locale issues

## Technical Implementation Details

- Used Paraglide's `setLocale`, `getLocale`, `localizeHref`, and `deLocalizeHref` functions for consistent behavior
- Created proper CSS variables for animations with cross-theme support
- Implemented accessible UI for language switcher with proper ARIA attributes
- Added detailed console logging for locale state tracking

## Future Considerations

- Further refinement of AUTO mode for consistent browser behavior
- Potential enable of the attention-grabbing animation for non-default locales
- Additional server-side approaches to manage Paraglide's cookie setting behavior
- More advanced environment variable validation at build and development time
