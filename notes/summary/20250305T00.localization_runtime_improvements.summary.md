# L10N Runtime Improvements

In this session, we focused on improving the user experience for website development, particularly around handling language configurations and ensuring the UI correctly reflects active locales.

## Key Improvements

1. **Fixed language menu display**: Implemented a solution to ensure the language selector only shows available languages based on the developer's active locales configuration.

2. **Streamlined development workflow**: Created a more robust setup process that automatically runs when the development server starts, eliminating the need for manual setup steps.

3. **Enhanced language configuration handling**: 
   - Improved detection and handling of locale settings from .env files
   - Added proper support for the "all" value in VITE_ACTIVE_LOCALES
   - Made the language menu reflect the configured languages

4. **Runtime patching solution**:
   - Created a solution that patches Paraglide's runtime after it's generated
   - Ensures language menu and routing only use configured languages
   - Handles file permissions to prevent rewriting by Paraglide

5. **Automated setup process**:
   - Modified vite.config.ts to automatically run setup checks
   - Ensured proper directory structure before server start
   - Coordinated patching to happen at the right time in the startup sequence

## Implementation Details

- **Runtime patching approach**:
  - Waits for Paraglide to generate its runtime.js file
  - Makes it writable, patches the available languages array
  - Makes it read-only to prevent Paraglide from regenerating it
  - Uses active locales from .env or defaults to English

- **Streamlined Vite configuration**:
  - Runs setup scripts on server start via a plugin
  - Executes patches after the HTTP server is listening
  - Provides clear status messages about language configuration

- **Developer UX improvements**:
  - Simplified "pnpm run dev" command to handle all setup automatically
  - Added clear messages about language configuration
  - Made switching between language configurations more reliable

## Limitations & Known Issues

- Accessing URLs with an inactive language prefix can result in unexpected behavior
- The current solution simplifies development but doesn't modify Paraglide's internal routing
- Special handling may be needed when running builds for production to ensure correct language configuration

## Next Steps

- Test the build process to ensure runtime patching works in production
- Verify that local translation works correctly with the new configuration
- Consider improving the handling of URLs with inactive language prefixes
- Document the development workflow for future contributors
