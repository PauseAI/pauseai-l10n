      # Environment Detection Refactoring and Build Process Optimization

      ## Overview

      This session focused on several key improvements to the PauseAI website localization build process:

      1. Fixing the issue with redundant Paraglide compilation during the build process
      2. Addressing the problem of locale overrides not being respected throughout the entire build chain
      3. Optimizing the build process by removing unnecessary steps and improving environment detection
      4. Implementing a more robust script architecture with proper error handling and recovery
      5. Adding dry run functionality for translation cost estimation

      ## Architecture Changes

      ### Setup Script Consolidation

      We removed the redundant `setup.ts` script and integrated its functionality into `inlang-settings.ts`. This eliminated duplicate operations and
       simplified the build pipeline. The new architecture:

      - Uses `inlang-settings.ts` as the centralized entry point for all localization setup needs
      - Properly respects environment variables and implements intelligent caching
      - Creates a hash-based cache to avoid unnecessary operations when the environment hasn't changed
      - Implements robust error handling with appropriate fallbacks

      ### Code Modularization

      We split the monolithic translation script into smaller, more maintainable modules:

      - `git-ops.ts`: Handles all Git repository operations
      - `utils.ts`: Provides common utility functions for file operations and environment detection
      - `dry-run.ts`: Implements cost estimation and reporting
      - `translate-core.ts`: Core translation functionality

      ### Environment Detection

      We significantly improved the environment detection logic:

      - Created a centralized way to detect development vs. production environments
      - Implemented proper handling of environment variables in all contexts (Node.js and browser)
      - Added extensive logging to show the logic behind environment decisions
      - Ensured consistency across all components

      ## Build Process Optimizations

      ### Caching Improvements

      - Added intelligent caching based on environment variables and settings
      - Implemented a hash-based approach to detect meaningful changes
      - Reused computed values where possible to reduce redundant operations
      - Added clear cache invalidation logic

      ### Locale Management

      We identified an issue where inactive locales (those excluded by `PARAGLIDE_LOCALES` environment variable) were still being processed during
      build, causing unnecessary work. The solution requires:

      - Using the runtime's `locales` property as the source of truth
      - Cleaning up inactive locale directories in the translation repository working copy
      - Ensuring consistency between environment overrides and the actual build process

      ### Bootstrap Logic for Missing Runtime

      We improved the bootstrap procedure when the runtime is missing:

      - Implemented a robust dynamic import approach in the translation script
      - Added clear error messages and recovery options
      - Ensured proper environment-awareness throughout the bootstrap process

      ## New Features

      ### Translation Cost Estimation

      We implemented comprehensive dry run functionality:

      - Added detailed token usage and cost estimation
      - Created per-language statistics reporting
      - Implemented a summary view for quick cost assessments
      - Added verbose mode for detailed file-by-file reporting

      ### Build Targets

      Added new npm script targets for different build scenarios:

      - `build:dev`: Builds with development environment settings
      - `build:spend`: Forces translation updates regardless of caching
      - `translate:dry-run`: Estimates translation costs without making API calls
      - `translate:estimate`: Shows detailed, verbose cost estimates

      ## Future Work

      1. **Repository Management**: Move repository management from `inlang-settings.ts` to the translation scripts since they already access the
      compiled runtime.

      2. **Locale Directory Cleanup**: Implement the cleanup of inactive locale directories to prevent unnecessary processing during builds.

      3. **Continued Build Optimization**: Further investigate and optimize the Vite/SvelteKit build process to ensure it respects locale overrides.

      4. **Documentation Updates**: Update relevant documentation to reflect the new architecture and build process.

      ## Key Technical Insights

      - Using dynamic imports allows bypassing ESM scanning limitations when accessing files that may not exist yet
      - Environment variables need to be handled consistently throughout the entire build chain
      - Properly cleaning up filesystem artifacts is crucial for build performance
      - Using the runtime as the source of truth for locales ensures consistency
