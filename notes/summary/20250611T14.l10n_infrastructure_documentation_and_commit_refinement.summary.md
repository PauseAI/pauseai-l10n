# L10n Infrastructure Documentation and Commit Refinement

**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Branch**: l10-preview  
**Focus**: Comprehensive documentation and commit message improvements for l10n infrastructure

## Overview

This session focused on documenting the completed l10n infrastructure and refining commit messages to better explain the technical decisions and implementation details. The work built upon the atomic commits created in previous sessions.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation Created

#### README.md Updates
- Added clear explanation of localization vs translation
- Restructured with Quick Start section and pnpm commands front and center
- Clarified zero-config development experience (all commands default to en-only)
- Moved l10n-specific details to separate L10N.md

#### L10N.md - Comprehensive Developer Guide
- Complete documentation of the three l10n modes (en-only, dry-run, perform)
- CLI usage guide with automatic integration (pnpm dev vs build behavior)
- Branch safety system explanation with clear examples
- L10n cage architecture and metaphor (Cache Adopting Git's Engine)
- Force mode glob pattern documentation
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

#### template.env Updates
- Updated to use new L10N_ prefixed environment variables
- Added L10N_BRANCH documentation
- Clarified CI vs local defaults behavior

### 2. Environment Behavior Fix

Changed `isDev()` implementation to use CI detection instead of NODE_ENV:
- Before: Complex NODE_ENV/MODE logic that was inconsistent
- After: Simple `env.CI !== 'true'` check
- Result: All local commands (dev/build/preview) default to en-only mode unless configured

This ensures zero-config development works for ALL commands, not just `pnpm dev`.

### 3. Commit Message Refinements

Used interactive rebase to improve all 5 implementation commits with:
- Clear descriptions using L10N.md terminology ("l10n cage", "captured l10ns", "prompts LLMs")
- Key implementation details from the v2 plan
- References to L10N.md sections for further reading
- Technical decisions explained (e.g., commit splitting for git history preservation)

Final commit structure:
1. **Branch safety system** - Including SSH auto-detection, CI security, credential testing
2. **Mode system** - With removed isDev() auto-dry-run behavior noted
3. **Force mode** - With comprehensive glob pattern examples
4. **Terminology migration part 1** - File renames preserving git history
5. **Complete integration** - Final terminology updates and feature integration
6. **Documentation** - All new docs in a clean separate commit

## Technical Details

### L10n Cage Metaphor
Established consistent terminology throughout:
- Cage "holds captured l10n content" (dry-run mode)
- LLMs are "prompted to capture new l10ns" (perform mode)
- Content is "locked by committing" and "shipped by pushing"

### Branch Mapping Clarification
Made it clear that developers work on website branches, and the l10n system automatically creates/uses matching cage branches. No manual cage branch management needed.

### CI/CD Integration
Documented that most developers never need to run l10n locally - the CI/CD system handles it automatically when pull requests are created (including from CMS).

## Current Status

- ✅ L10n infrastructure fully implemented with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Complete documentation for developers at all levels
- ✅ Clean git history with well-documented atomic commits
- ✅ Ready for merge to main branch

## Next Steps

1. Final review of commits before merge to main
2. Deploy completed infrastructure to production
3. Return to investigating en-prefix/500 error issues

## Notes

- The current main branch limitation (en-only locale) is temporary and documented
- Developers should target PRs to `l10-preview` branch to see full l10n in action
- SSH auto-detection and CI security improvements provide better developer experience
