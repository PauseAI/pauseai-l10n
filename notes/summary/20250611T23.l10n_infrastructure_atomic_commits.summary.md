# L10n Infrastructure Atomic Commits Implementation

**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours  
**Branch:** l10-preview  
**Context:** Implementing atomic commits for l10n infrastructure before merging to main

## Achievements

### 1. Branch Safety Module Extraction ✅
- **Issue:** Functions duplicated between `git-ops.ts` and new `branch-safety.ts`
- **Solution:** Clean extraction of 7 branch safety functions to dedicated module
- **Files created:** `scripts/l10n/branch-safety.ts`, `scripts/l10n/branch-safety.test.ts`
- **Key functions:** `l10nCageBranch()`, `validateBranchForWrite()`, `canPushToRemote()`, etc.
- **Updated imports:** Fixed dependencies in `mode.ts`, `run.ts`, `git-ops.ts`, `clean.ts`

### 2. Test Infrastructure Improvements ✅
- **Fixed:** `test-mode.ts` vs `mode.test.ts` redundancy
- **Added:** Missing CI invalid API key test to `mode.test.ts` (critical safety test)
- **Converted:** `branch-safety.test.ts` from standalone script to proper vitest suite
- **Removed:** Redundant `test-mode.ts` after consolidating tests
- **Result:** All tests pass with proper vitest integration

### 3. Function Naming Improvements ✅
- **Renamed:** `getCurrentGitBranch()` → `currentWebsiteBranch()` (clarity: reads pauseai-website branch)
- **Renamed:** `getL10nBranch()` → `l10nCageBranch()` (clarity: determines l10n cage branch)
- **Updated:** All references and documentation

### 4. Atomic Commit Strategy Executed ✅
Successfully created 3 atomic commits:

**Commit 1:** `feat: add branch safety module` (fc15901)
- Added standalone branch safety module with vitest tests
- No breaking changes - pure addition

**Commit 2:** `feat: add l10n mode system with comprehensive testing` (6d18e4f)  
- Added `L10N_CAGE_DIR` constant to `src/lib/l10n.ts` (keeping old constants)
- Added complete Mode class with 20 comprehensive tests
- Includes critical CI safety test for invalid API keys

**Commit 3:** `feat: add l10n force mode with glob pattern support` (b5f965b)
- Added force mode with minimatch glob pattern support
- 14 comprehensive tests including filesystem integration tests
- Supports patterns like `*.md`, `2024-*`, `{join,donate}.md`

### 5. Git Repository Management ✅
- **Avoided broken commits:** Fixed staging issues that accidentally included file renames
- **Stashed full refactor:** Saved complete l10n.ts terminology migration for later commit
- **Clean history:** Each commit builds incrementally without breaking existing functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Branch Safety Architecture
- **Centralized branch logic:** Environment detection (CI, PR previews, branch deploys)
- **Safety validation:** Prevents local dev writes to main branch
- **Git operations:** SSH auto-detection, upstream tracking, credential testing
- **Clean separation:** Branch safety isolated from general git operations

### Mode System Design
- **Three operation modes:** `en-only`, `dry-run`, `perform`
- **Comprehensive validation:** API key length, branch safety, Git credentials
- **CI-aware:** Different behavior for CI vs local development
- **Safety-first:** Fails loudly rather than silently falling back

### Force Mode Features
- **Glob pattern support:** Full minimatch syntax including wildcards, brace expansion
- **Filesystem integration:** Tests against real source files
- **Comprehensive patterns:** `*.md`, `2024-*`, `{join,donate}.md`, character classes
- **Deduplication:** Handles overlapping patterns correctly

## Next Steps Planned

### 4. Directory Rename Commit
- Implement file renames: `scripts/translation/*` → `scripts/l10n/*`
- Handle git rename detection properly
- User implemented as two commits due to git rename limitations

### 5. Complete Terminology Migration 
- Update all import paths after directory rename
- Complete l10n terminology throughout codebase
- Integrate new mode/force systems into existing code
- Update package.json script targets

### 6. Edge Function Test Infrastructure
- Add test API routes for investigating 500 errors
- Focus on prefix-all-locales debugging

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ **All tests pass:** 46 total tests across 4 test files
- ✅ **No broken commits:** Each commit is independently buildable
- ✅ **Clean git history:** Atomic commits with clear purposes
- ✅ **Zero regression:** Existing functionality completely unchanged
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing:** Branch safety, mode system, force patterns all covered

## Development Methodology

- **Coding centaur approach:** Close collaboration, plan-then-execute
- **Incremental commits:** Build infrastructure piece by piece
- **Safety-first:** No broken intermediate states
- **Test-driven:** Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Documentation-aware:** Plan to write docs before merging to main

## Context for Next Session

- **Current status:** 3 clean atomic commits ready
- **Stashed work:** Full l10n.ts refactoring waiting to be applied
- **Remaining tasks:** Directory renames, terminology migration, integration
- **Goal:** Merge clean l10n infrastructure to main branch
- **Documentation:** Plan to write comprehensive docs before final merge
