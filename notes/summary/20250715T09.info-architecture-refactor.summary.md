# Session Summary: Info Architecture Refactor

**Date**: 2025-07-15
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Participants**: Anthony, Claude

## Objective
Fix state restoration issues in the write tool and implement a unified information architecture for client-server data sharing.

## Key Decisions & Changes

### 1. Fixed State Restoration Bug
- **Issue**: UI didn't reflect completed Stage 1 state after reload
- **Root Cause**: `timedRounds` weren't being restored from localStorage
- **Solution**: Added proper restoration in `onMount` without artificial patching

### 2. Unified Information Architecture
- **Decision**: Use a single `info` object structure shared between client and server
- **Benefits**:
  - Single source of truth
  - No conversion between arrays and fields
  - Clean serialization
  - Extensible for different workflows
- **Implementation**: Started with Stage 1 migration, removed `contacts_inputs` array

### 3. Fixed Caching System
- **Issue**: Caching logic was in wrong place, breaking transparent operation
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved caching into `callClaude` function
  - Added prompt matching with 409 Conflict response
  - Fixed round state management bug where `state.round = 'start'` persisted

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **Added**: Proper 409 error display in UI using existing `warning error` style
- **Created**: Generic `ux` object for UI state persistence
- **Result**: Errors now display properly and persist across reloads

## Technical Details

### Server-Side Changes
1. Added `info` and `information` fields to `WriteState` interface
2. Fixed bug where `state.information` was used but not defined
3. Refactored `callClaude` to accept state object instead of many parameters
4. Fixed `getCurrentRound` logic that prevented round execution

### Client-Side Changes
1. Removed `contacts_inputs` array, using `info.discover.search` instead
2. Created generic `ux` object synchronized with UI state variables
3. Updated all `saveToStorage` calls to include ux state
4. Added error display below progress dialog

## Current Status
- Stage 1 fully migrated to info architecture
- Caching system working correctly with prompt validation
- Error handling complete with proper UI feedback
- Ready for incremental migration of remaining stages

## Next Steps
1. Migrate Stage 2-5 to info architecture
2. Remove remaining input arrays
3. Update server handlers to use info structure
4. Consider renaming `currentStateToken` to better reflect its purpose
